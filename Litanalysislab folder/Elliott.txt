\
\
I. The Case of Miss Elliott\
\
Chapter I\
\
The man in the corner was watching me over the top of his great\
bone-rimmed spectacles.\
\
\'93Well?\'94 he asked, after a little while.\
\
\'93Well?\'94 I repeated with some acerbity. I had been wondering for the\
last ten minutes how many more knots he would manage to make in that\
same bit of string, before he actually started undoing them again.\
\
\'93Do I fidget you?\'94 he asked apologetically, whilst his long bony\
fingers buried themselves, string, knots, and all, into the capacious\
pockets of his magnificent tweed ulster.\
\
\'93Yes, that is another awful tragedy,\'94 he said quietly, after a while.\
\'93Lady doctors are having a pretty bad time of it just now.\'94\
\
This was only his usual habit of speaking in response to my thoughts.\
There was no doubt that at the present moment my mind was filled with\
that extraordinary mystery which was setting all Scotland Yard by the\
ears, and had completely thrown into the shade the sad story of Miss\
Hickman\'92s tragic fate.\
\
The _Daily Telegraph_ had printed two columns headed \'93Murder or\
Suicide?\'94 on the subject of the mysterious death of Miss Elliott,\
matron of the Convalescent Home, in Suffolk Avenue\'97and I must confess\
that a more profound and bewildering mystery had never been set before\
our able detective department.\
\
\'93It has puzzled them this time, and no mistake,\'94 said the man in the\
corner, with one of his most gruesome chuckles, \'93but I daresay the\
public is quite satisfied that there is no solution to be found, since\
the police have found none.\'94\
\
\'93Can you find one?\'94 I retorted with withering sarcasm.\
\
\'93Oh, my solution would only be sneered at,\'94 he replied. \'93It is far too\
simple\'97and yet how logical! There was Miss Elliott, a good-looking,\
youngish, lady-like woman, fully qualified in the medical profession\
and in charge of the Convalescent Home in Suffolk Avenue, which is a\
private institution largely patronised by the benevolent.\
\
\'93For some time, already, there had appeared vague comments and rumours\
in various papers, that the extensive charitable contributions did not\
all go towards the up-keep of the Home. But, as is usual in\
institutions of that sort, the public was not allowed to know anything\
very definite, and contributions continued to flow in, whilst the\
Honorary Treasurer of the great Convalescent Home kept up his\
beautiful house in Hamilton Terrace, in a style which would not have\
shamed a peer of the realm.\
\
\'93That is how matters stood, when on 2nd November last the morning\
papers contained the brief announcement that at a quarter past\
midnight two workmen walking along Blomfield Road, Maida Vale,\
suddenly came across the body of a young lady, lying on her face,\
close to the wooden steps of the narrow foot-bridge which at this\
point crosses the canal.\
\
\'93This part of Maida Vale is, as you know, very lonely at all times,\
but at night it is usually quite deserted. Blomfield Road, with its\
row of small houses and bits of front gardens, faces the canal, and\
beyond the foot-bridge is continued in a series of small riverside\
wharves, which is practically unknown ground to the average Londoner.\
The foot-bridge itself, with steps at right angles and high wooden\
parapet, would offer excellent shelter at all hours of the night for\
any nefarious deed.\
\
\'93It was within its shadows that the men had found the body, and to\
their credit be it said, they behaved like good and dutiful\
citizens\'97one of them went off in search of the police, whilst the\
other remained beside the corpse.\
\
\'93From papers and books found upon her person, it was soon ascertained\
that the deceased was Miss Elliott, the young matron of the Suffolk\
Avenue Convalescent Home; and as she was very popular in her\
profession and had a great many friends, the terrible tragedy caused a\
sensation, all the more acute as very quickly the rumour gained ground\
that the unfortunate young woman had taken her own life in a most\
gruesome and mysterious manner.\
\
\'93Preliminary medical and police investigation had revealed\
the fact that Miss Elliott had died through a deep and\
scientifically-administered gash in the throat, whilst the surgical\
knife with which the deadly wound was inflicted still lay tightly\
grasped in her clenched hand.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
The man in the corner, ever conscious of any effect he produced upon\
my excited imagination, had paused for a while, giving me time, as it\
were, to co-ordinate in my mind the few simple facts he had put before\
me. I had no wish to make a remark, knowing of old that my one chance\
of getting the whole of his interesting argument was to offer neither\
comment nor contradiction.\
\
\'93When a young, good-looking woman in the heyday of her success in an\
interesting profession,\'94 he began at last, \'93is alleged to have\
committed suicide, the outside public immediately want to know the\
reason why she did such a thing, and a kind of freemasonic, amateur\
detective work goes on, which generally brings a few important truths\
to light. Thus, in the case of Miss Elliott, certain facts had begun\
to leak out, even before the inquest, with its many sensational\
developments. Rumours concerning the internal administration, or\
rather maladministration of the Home began to take more definite form.\
\
\'93That its finances had been in a very shaky condition for some time\
was known to all those who were interested in its welfare. What was\
not so universally known was that few hospitals had had more\
munificent donations and subscriptions showered upon them in recent\
years, and yet it was openly spoken of by all the nurses that Miss\
Elliott had on more than one occasion petitioned for actual\
necessities for the patients\'97necessities which were denied to her on\
the plea of necessary economy.\
\
\'93The Convalescent Home was, as sometimes happens in institutions of\
this sort, under the control of a committee of benevolent and\
fashionable people who understood nothing about business, and less\
still about the management of a hospital. Dr. Kinnaird, President of\
the institution, was a young, eminently successful consultant; he had\
recently married the daughter of a peer, who had boundless ambitions\
for herself and her husband.\
\
\'93Dr. Kinnaird, by adding the prestige of his name to the Home, no\
doubt felt that he had done enough for its welfare. Against that, Dr.\
Stapylton, Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Home, threw himself\
heart and soul into the work connected with it, and gave a great deal\
of his time to it. All subscriptions and donations went, of course,\
through his hands, the benevolent and fashionable committee being only\
too willing to shift all their financial responsibilities on to his\
willing shoulders. He was a very popular man in society\'97a bachelor\
with a magnificent house in Hamilton Terrace, where he entertained the\
more eminent and fashionable clique in his own profession.\
\
\'93It was the evening papers, however, which contained the most\
sensational development of this tragic case. It appears that on the\
Saturday afternoon Mary Dawson, one of the nurses in the Home was\
going to the house surgeon\'92s office with a message from the head\
nurse, when her attention was suddenly arrested in one of the passages\
by the sound of loud voices proceeding from one of the rooms. She\
paused to listen for a moment and at once recognised the voices of\
Miss Elliott and of Dr. Stapylton, the Honorary Treasurer and Chairman\
of Committee.\
\
\'93The subject of conversation was evidently that of the eternal\
question of finance. Miss Elliott spoke very indignantly, and Nurse\
Dawson caught the words:\
\
\'93\'91Surely you must agree with me that Dr. Kinnaird ought to be informed\
at once.\'92\
\
\'93Dr. Stapylton\'92s voice in reply seems to have been at first bitingly\
sarcastic, then threatening. Dawson heard nothing more after that, and\
went on to deliver her message. On her way back she stopped in the\
passage again, and tried to listen. This time it seemed to her as if\
she could hear the sound of some one crying bitterly, and Dr.\
Stapylton\'92s voice speaking very gently.\
\
\'93\'91You may be right, Nellie,\'92 he was saying. \'91At any rate, wait a few\
days before telling Kinnaird. You know what he is\'97he\'92ll make a\
frightful fuss and\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93Whereupon Miss Elliott interrupted him.\
\
\'93\'91It isn\'92t fair to Dr. Kinnaird to keep him in ignorance any longer.\
Whoever the thief may be it is your duty or mine to expose him, and if\
necessary bring him to justice.\'92\
\
\'93There was a good deal of discussion at the time, if you remember, as\
to whether Nurse Dawson had overheard and repeated this speech\
accurately: whether, in point of fact, Miss Elliott had used the words\
\'91_or_ mine\'92 or \'91_and_ mine.\'92 You see the neat little point, don\'92t\
you?\'94 continued the man in the corner. \'93The little word \'91and\'92 would\
imply that she considered herself at one with Dr. Stapylton in the\
matter, but \'91or\'92 would mean that she was resolved to act alone if he\
refused to join her in unmasking the thief.\
\
\'93All these facts, as I remarked before, had leaked out, as such facts\
have a way of doing. No wonder, therefore, that on the day fixed for\
the inquest the coroner\'92s court was filled to overflowing, both with\
the public\'97ever eager for new sensations\'97and with the many friends of\
the deceased lady, among whom young medical students of both sexes and\
nurses in uniform were most conspicuous.\
\
\'93I was there early, and therefore had a good seat, from which I could\
comfortably watch the various actors in the drama about to be\
performed. People who seemed to be in the know pointed out various\
personages to one another, and it was a matter of note that, in spite\
of professional engagements, the members of the staff of the\
Convalescent Home were present in full force and stayed on almost the\
whole time. The personages who chiefly arrested my attention were,\
firstly, Dr. Kinnaird, a good-looking Irishman of about forty, and\
President of the institution; also Dr. Earnshaw, a rising young\
consultant, with boundless belief in himself written all over his\
pleasant rubicund countenance.\
\
\'93The expert medical evidence was once again thoroughly gone into.\
There was absolutely no doubt that Miss Elliott had died from having\
her throat cut with the surgical knife which was found grasped in her\
right hand. There was absolutely no signs of a personal struggle in\
the immediate vicinity of the body, and rigid examination proved that\
there was no other mark of violence upon the body; there was nothing\
therefore, to prove that the poor girl had not committed suicide in a\
moment of mental aberration or of great personal grief.\
\
\'93Of course, it was strange that she should have chosen this curious\
mode of taking her own life. She had access to all kinds of poisons,\
amongst which her medical knowledge could prompt her to choose the\
least painful and most efficacious ones. Therefore, to have walked out\
on a Sunday night to a wretched and unfrequented spot and there\
committed suicide in that grim fashion seemed almost the work of a mad\
woman. And yet the evidence of her family and friends all tended to\
prove that Miss Elliott was a peculiarly sane, large-minded, and happy\
individual.\
\
\'93However, the suicide theory was at this stage of the proceedings\
taken as being absolutely established, and when Police-Constable Fiske\
came forward to give his evidence no one in the court was prepared for\
a statement which suddenly revealed this case to be as mysterious as\
it was tragic.\
\
\'93Fiske\'92s story was this: Close upon midnight on that memorable Sunday\
night he was walking down Blomfield Road along the side of the canal\
and towards the foot-bridge, when he overtook a lady and gentleman who\
were walking in the same direction as himself. He turned to look at\
them, and noticed that the gentleman was in evening dress and wore a\
high hat, and that the lady was crying.\
\
\'93Blomfield Road is at best very badly lighted, especially on the side\
next to the canal, where there are no lamps at all. Fiske, however,\
was prepared to swear positively that the lady was the deceased. As\
for the gentleman, he might know him again or he might not.\
\
\'93Fiske then crossed the foot-bridge, and walked on towards the Harrow\
Road. As he did so, he heard St. Mary Magdalen\'92s church clock chime\
the hour of midnight. It was a quarter of an hour after that, that the\
body of the unfortunate girl was found, and clasping in her hand the\
knife with which that awful deed had been done. By whom? Was it really\
by her own self? But if so, why did not that man in evening dress who\
had last seen her alive come forward and throw some light upon this\
fast thickening veil of mystery?\
\
\'93It was Mr. James Elliott, brother of the deceased, however, who first\
mentioned a name then in open court, which has ever since in the minds\
of every one been associated with Miss Elliott\'92s tragic fate.\
\
\'93He was speaking in answer to a question of the coroner\'92s anent his\
sister\'92s disposition and recent frame of mind.\
\
\'93\'91She was always extremely cheerful,\'92 he said, \'91but recently had been\
peculiarly bright and happy. I understood from her that this was\
because she believed that a man for whom she had a great regard was\
also very much attached to her, and meant to ask her to be his wife.\'92\
\
\'93\'91And do you know who this man was?\'92 asked the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91Oh, yes,\'92 replied Mr. Elliott, \'91it was Dr. Stapylton.\'92\
\
\'93Every one had expected that name of course, for every one remembered\
Nurse Dawson\'92s story, yet when it came, there crept over all those\
present an undescribable feeling that something terrible was\
impending.\
\
\'93\'91Is Dr. Stapylton here?\'92\
\
\'93But Dr. Stapylton had sent in an excuse. A professional case of the\
utmost urgency had kept him at a patient\'92s bedside. But Dr. Kinnaird,\
the President of the institution, came forward.\
\
\'93Questioned by the coroner, Dr. Kinnaird, however, who evidently had a\
great regard for his colleague, repudiated any idea that the funds of\
the institution had ever been tampered with by the Treasurer.\
\
\'93\'91The very suggestion of such a thing,\'92 he said, \'91was an outrage upon\
one of the most brilliant men in the profession.\'92\
\
\'93He further added that, although he knew that Dr. Stapylton thought\
very highly of Miss Elliott, he did not think that there was any\
actual engagement, and most decidedly he (Dr. Kinnaird) had heard\
nothing of any disagreement between them.\
\
\'93\'91Then did Dr. Stapylton never tell you that Miss Elliott had often\
chafed under the extraordinary economy practised in the richly-endowed\
Home?\'92 asked the coroner again.\
\
\'93\'91No,\'92 replied Dr. Kinnaird.\
\
\'93\'91Was not that rather strange reticence?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Certainly not. I am only the Honorary President of the\
institution\'97Stapylton has chief control of its finances.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Ah!\'92 remarked the coroner blandly.\
\
\'93However, it was clearly no business of his at this moment to enter\
into the financial affairs of the Home. His duty at this point was to\
try and find out if Dr. Stapylton and the man in evening dress were\
one and the same person.\
\
\'93The men who found the body testified to the hour: a quarter past\
midnight. As Fiske had seen the unfortunate girl alive a little before\
twelve, she must have been murdered or had committed suicide between\
midnight and a quarter past. But there was something more to come.\
\
\'93How strange and dramatic it all was!\'94 continued the man in the\
corner, with a bland smile, altogether out of keeping with the\
poignancy of his narrative; \'93all these people in that crowded court\
trying to reconstruct the last chapter of that bright young matron\'92s\
life and then\'97but I must not anticipate.\
\
\'93One more witness was to be heard\'97one whom the police, with a totally\
unconscious sense of what is dramatic, had reserved for the last. This\
was Dr. Earnshaw, one of the staff of the Convalescent Home. His\
evidence was very short, but of deeply momentous import. He explained\
that he had consulting rooms in Weymouth Street, but resided in\
Westbourne Square. On Sunday, 1st November, he had been dining out in\
Maida Vale, and returning home a little before midnight saw a woman\
standing close by the steps of the foot-bridge in the Blomfield Road.\
\
\'93\'91I had been coming down Formosa Street and had not specially taken\
notice of her, when just as I reached the corner of Blomfield Road she\
was joined by a man in evening dress and high hat. Then I crossed the\
road, and recognised both Miss Elliott and\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93The young doctor paused, almost as if hesitating before the enormity\
of what he was about to say, whilst the excitement in court became\
almost painful.\
\
\'93\'91And\'97\'97?\'92 urged the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91And Dr. Stapylton,\'92 said Dr. Earnshaw at last, almost under his\
breath.\
\
\'93\'91You are quite sure?\'92 asked the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91Absolutely positive. I spoke to them both, and they spoke to me.\'92\
\
\'93\'91What did you say?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh, the usual, \'93Hello, Stapylton,\'94 to which he replied, \'93Hello!\'94 I\
then said \'93Good-night\'94 to them both, and Miss Elliott also said\
\'93Good-night.\'94 I saw her face more clearly then, and thought that she\
looked very tearful and unhappy, and Stapylton looked ill-tempered. I\
wondered why they had chosen that unhallowed spot for a midnight\
walk.\'92\
\
\'93\'91And you say the hour was\'97\'97?\'92 asked the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91Ten minutes to twelve. I looked at my watch as I crossed the\
foot-bridge, and had heard a quarter to twelve strike five minutes\
before.\'92\
\
\'93Then it was that the coroner adjourned the inquest. Dr. Stapylton\'92s\
attendance had become absolutely imperative. According to Dr.\
Earnshaw\'92s testimony, he had been with deceased certainly a quarter of\
an hour before she met her terrible death. Fiske had seen them\
together ten minutes later; she was then crying bitterly. There was as\
yet no actual charge against the fashionable and rich doctor, but\
already the ghostly bird of suspicion had touched him with its ugly\
wing.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93As for the next day,\'94 continued the man in the corner after a slight\
pause, \'93I can assure you that there was not a square foot of standing\
room in the coroner\'92s court for the adjourned inquest. It was timed\
for eleven a.m., and at six o\'92clock on that cold winter\'92s morning the\
pavement outside the court was already crowded. As for me, I always\
manage to get a front seat, and I did on that occasion, too. I fancy\
that I was the first among the general public to note Dr. Stapylton as\
he entered the room accompanied by his solicitor, and by Dr. Kinnaird,\
with whom he was chatting very cheerfully and pleasantly.\
\
\'93Mind you, I am a great admirer of the medical profession, and I think\
a clever and successful doctor usually has a most delightful air about\
him\'97the consciousness of great and good work done\'97with profit to\
himself\'97which is quite unique and quite admirable.\
\
\'93Dr. Stapylton had that air even to a greater extent than his\
colleague, and from the affectionate way in which Dr. Kinnaird finally\
shook him by the hand, it was quite clear that the respected chief of\
the Convalescent Home, at any rate, refused to harbour any suspicion\
of the integrity of its Treasurer.\
\
\'93Well, I must not weary you by dwelling on the unimportant details of\
this momentous inquest. Constable Fiske, who was asked to identify the\
gentleman in evening dress whom he had seen with the deceased at a few\
minutes before twelve, failed to recognise Dr. Stapylton very\
positively: pressed very closely, he finally refused to swear either\
way. Against that, Dr. Earnshaw repeated clearly and categorically,\
looking his colleague straight in the face the while, the damnatory\
evidence he had given the day before.\
\
\'93\'91I saw Dr. Stapylton, I spoke to him, and he spoke to me,\'92 he\
repeated most emphatically.\
\
\'93Every one in that court was watching Dr. Stapylton\'92s face, which wore\
an air of supreme nonchalance, even of contempt, but certainly neither\
of guilt nor of fear.\
\
\'93Of course, by that time _I_ had fully made up my mind as to where the\
hitch lay in this extraordinary mystery; but no one else had, and\
every one held their breath as Dr. Stapylton quietly stepped into the\
box, and after a few preliminary questions the coroner asked him very\
abruptly:\
\
\'93\'91You were in the company of the deceased a few minutes before she\
died, Dr. Stapylton?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Pardon me,\'92 replied the latter quietly, \'91I last saw Miss Elliott\
alive on Saturday afternoon, just before I went home from my work.\'92\
\
\'93This calm reply, delivered without a tremor, positively made every\
one gasp. For the moment coroner and jury were alike staggered.\
\
\'93\'91But we have two witnesses here who saw you in the company of the\
deceased within a few minutes of twelve o\'92clock on the Sunday night!\'92\
the coroner managed to gasp out at last.\
\
\'93\'91Pardon me,\'92 again interposed the doctor, \'91these witnesses were\
mistaken.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Mistaken!\'92\
\
\'93I think every one would have shouted out the word in boundless\
astonishment had they dared to do so.\
\
\'93\'91Dr. Earnshaw was mistaken,\'92 reiterated Dr. Stapylton quietly. \'91He\
neither saw me nor did he speak to me.\'92\
\
\'93\'91You can substantiate that, of course?\'92 queried the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91Pardon me,\'92 once more said the doctor, with utmost calm, \'91it is\
surely Dr. Earnshaw who should substantiate _his_ statement.\'92\
\
\'93\'91There is Constable Fiske\'92s corroborative evidence for that,\'92\
retorted the coroner, somewhat nettled.\
\
\'93\'91Hardly, I think. You see, the constable states that he saw a\
gentleman in evening dress, etc., talking to the deceased at a minute\
or two before twelve o\'92clock, and that when he heard the clock of St.\
Mary Magdalen chime the hour of midnight he was just walking away from\
the foot-bridge. Now, just as that very church clock was chiming that\
hour, I was stepping into a cab at the corner of Harrow Road, not a\
hundred yards _in front_ of Constable Fiske.\'92\
\
\'93\'91You swear to that?\'92 queried the coroner in amazement.\
\
\'93\'91I can easily prove it,\'92 said Dr. Stapylton. \'91The cabman who drove me\
from there to my club is here and can corroborate my statement.\'92\
\
\'93And amidst boundless excitement, John Smith, a hansom cab-driver,\
stated that he was hailed in the Harrow Road by the last witness, who\
told him to drive to the Royal Clinical Club, in Mardon Street. Just\
as he started off, St. Mary Magdalen\'92s church, close by, struck the\
hour of midnight.\
\
\'93At that very moment, if you remember, Constable Fiske had just\
crossed the foot-bridge, and was walking towards the Harrow Road, and\
he was quite sure (for he was closely questioned afterwards) that no\
one overtook him from behind. Now there would be no way of getting\
from one side of the canal to the other at this point except over that\
foot-bridge; the nearest bridge is fully two hundred yards further\
down the Blomfield Road. The girl was alive a minute _before_ the\
constable crossed the foot-bridge, and it would have been absolutely\
impossible for any one to have murdered a girl, placed the knife in\
her hand, run a couple of hundred yards to the next bridge and another\
three hundred to the corner of Harrow Road, all in the space of three\
minutes.\
\
\'93This _alibi_, therefore, absolutely cleared Dr. Stapylton from any\
suspicion of having murdered Miss Elliott. And yet, looking on that\
man as he sat there, calm, cool and contemptuous, no one could have\
had the slightest doubt but that he was lying\'97lying when he said he\
had not seen Miss Elliott that evening; lying when he denied Dr.\
Earnshaw\'92s statement; lying when he professed himself ignorant of the\
poor girl\'92s fate.\
\
\'93Dr. Earnshaw repeated his statement with the same emphasis, but it\
was one man\'92s word against another\'92s, and as Dr. Stapylton was so\
glaringly innocent of the actual murder, there seemed no valid reason\
at all why he should have denied having seen her that night, and the\
point was allowed to drop. As for Nurse Dawson\'92s story of his alleged\
quarrel with Miss Elliott on the Saturday night, Dr. Stapylton again\
had a simple and logical explanation.\
\
\'93\'91People who listen at keyholes,\'92 he said quietly, \'91are apt to hear\
only fragments of conversation, and often mistake ordinary loud voices\
for quarrels. As a matter of fact, Miss Elliott and I were discussing\
the dismissal of certain nurses from the Home, whom she deemed\
incompetent. Nurse Dawson was among that number. She desired their\
immediate dismissal, and I tried to pacify her. That was the subject\
of my conversation with the deceased lady. I can swear to every word\
of it.\'92\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
The man in the corner had long ceased speaking, and was placing\
quietly before me a number of photographs. One by one I saw the series\
of faces which had been watched so eagerly in the coroner\'92s court that\
memorable afternoon by an excited crowd.\
\
\'93So the fate of poor Miss Elliott has remained wrapt in mystery?\'94 I\
said thoughtfully at last.\
\
\'93To every one,\'94 rejoined the funny creature, \'93except to me.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! What is your theory, then?\'94\
\
\'93A simple one, dear lady: so simple that it really amazes me, that no\
one, not even you, my faithful pupil, ever thought of it.\'94\
\
\'93It may be so simple that it becomes idiotic,\'94 I retorted with lofty\
disdain.\
\
\'93Well, that may be. Shall I at any rate try to make it clear.\'94\
\
\'93If you like.\'94\
\
\'93For this I think the best way would be, if you were to follow me\
through what transpired before the inquest. But first tell me, what do\
you think of Dr. Earnshaw\'92s statement?\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 I replied, \'93a good many people thought that it was he who\
murdered Miss Elliott, and that his story of meeting Dr. Stapylton\
with her was a lie from beginning to end.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94 he retorted, making an elaborate knot in his bit of\
string. \'93Dr. Earnshaw\'92s friends, with whom he had been dining that\
night, swore that he was _not_ in evening dress, nor wore a high hat.\
And on that point\'97the evening dress, and the hat\'97Constable Fiske was\
most positive.\'94\
\
\'93Then Dr. Earnshaw was mistaken, and it was not Dr. Stapylton he met.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94 he shrieked, whilst another knot went to join its\
fellows. \'93He spoke to Dr. Stapylton, and Dr. Stapylton spoke to him.\'94\
\
\'93Very well, then,\'94 I argued; \'93why should Dr. Stapylton tell a lie\
about it? He had such a conclusive _alibi_ that there could be no\
object in his making a false statement about that.\'94\
\
\'93No object!\'94 shrieked the excited creature. \'93Why, don\'92t you _see_ that\
he had to tell the lie in order to set police, coroner and jury by the\
ears, because he did not wish it to be even remotely hinted at, that\
the man whom Dr. Earnshaw saw with Miss Elliott, and the man whom\
Constable Fiske saw with her ten minutes later, were _two different\
persons_.\'94\
\
\'93Two different persons!\'94 I ejaculated.\
\
\'93Ay! two confederates in this villany. No one has ever attempted to\
deny the truth of the shaky finances of the Home; no one has really\
denied that Miss Elliott suspected certain defalcations and was trying\
to force the hands of the Honorary Treasurer towards a full enquiry.\
That the Honorary Treasurer knew where all the money went to was\
pretty clear all along\'97his magnificent house in Hamilton Terrace fully\
testifies to that. That the President of the institution was a party\
to these defalcations and largely profited by them I for one am\
equally convinced.\'94\
\
\'93Dr. Kinnaird?\'94 I ejaculated in amazement.\
\
\'93Ay, Dr. Kinnaird. Do you mean to tell me that he alone among the\
entire staff of that Home was ignorant of those defalcations?\
Impossible! And if he knew of them, and did neither inquire into them\
nor attempt to stop them, then he _must_ have been a party to them. Do\
you admit that?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I admit that,\'94 I replied.\
\
\'93Very well, then. The rest is quite simple. Those two men, unworthy to\
bear the noble appellation of doctor, must for years have quietly\
stolen the money subscribed by the benevolent for the Home, and\
converted it to their own use: then, they suddenly find themselves\
face to face with immediate discovery in the shape of a young girl\
determined to unmask the systematic frauds of the past few years. That\
meant exposure, disgrace, ruin for them both, and they determine to be\
rid of her.\
\
\'93Under the pretence of an evening walk, her so-called lover entices\
her to a lonely and suitable spot; his confederate is close by, hidden\
in the shadows, ready to give him assistance if the girl struggles and\
screams. But suddenly Dr. Earnshaw appears. He recognises Stapylton\
and challenges him. For a moment the villains are nonplussed, then\
Kinnaird\'97the cleverer of the two\'97steps forward, greets the two lovers\
unconcernedly, and after two minutes\'92 conversation casually reminds\
Stapylton of an appointment the latter is presumed to have at a club\
in St. James\'92 Street.\
\
\'93The latter understands and takes the hint, and takes a quick farewell\
of the girl, leaving her in his friend\'92s charge, then as fast as he\
can, goes off, presently takes a cab, leaving his friend to do the\
deed, whilst the _alibi_ he can prove, coupled with Dr. Earnshaw\'92s\
statement, was sure to bewilder and mislead the police and the public.\
\
\'93Thus it was that though Dr. Earnshaw saw and recognised Dr.\
Stapylton, Constable Fiske saw Dr. Kinnaird, whom he did _not_\
recognise, on whom no suspicion had fallen, and whose name had never\
been coupled with that of Miss Elliott. When Constable Fiske had\
turned his back, Kinnaird murdered the girl and went off quietly,\
whilst Dr. Stapylton, on whom all suspicions were bound to fasten\
sooner or later, was able to prove the most perfect _alibi_ ever\
concocted.\
\
\'93One day I feel certain that the frauds at the Home will be\
discovered, and then who knows what else may see the light?\
\
\'93Think of it all quietly when I am gone, and to-morrow when we meet\
tell me whether if _I_ am wrong what is _your_ explanation of this\
extraordinary mystery.\'94\
\
Before I could reply he had gone, and I was left wondering, gazing at\
the photographs of two good-looking, highly respectable and respected\
men, whom an animated scarecrow had just boldly accused of committing\
one of the most dastardly crimes ever recorded in our annals.\
\
\
\
II. The Hocussing of Cigarette\
\
Chapter I\
\
Quite by chance I found myself one morning sitting before a\
marble-topped table in the A.B.C. shop. I really wondered for the\
moment what had brought me there, and felt cross with myself for being\
there at all. Having sampled my tea and roll, I soon buried myself in\
the capacious folds of my _Daily Telegraph_.\
\
\'93A glass of milk and a cheesecake, please,\'94 said a well-known voice.\
\
The next moment I was staring into the corner, straight at a pair of\
mild, watery blue eyes, hidden behind great bone-rimmed spectacles,\
and at ten long bony fingers, round which a piece of string was\
provokingly intertwined.\
\
There he was as usual, wearing\'97for it was chilly\'97a huge tweed ulster,\
of a pattern too lofty to be described. Smiling, bland, apologetic,\
and fidgety, he sat before me as the living embodiment of the reason\
why I had come to the A.B.C. shop that morning.\
\
\'93How do you do?\'94 I said with as much dignity as I could command.\
\
\'93I see that you are interested in Cigarette,\'94 he remarked, pointing to\
a special column in the _Daily Telegraph_.\
\
\'93She is quite herself again,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93Yes, but you don\'92t know who tried to poison her and succeeded in\
making her very ill. You don\'92t know whether the man Palk had anything\
to do with it, whether he was bribed, or whether it was Mrs. Keeson or\
the groom Cockram who told a lie, or why\'97\'97?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I admitted reluctantly; \'93I don\'92t know any of these things.\'94\
\
He was fidgeting nervously in the corner, wriggling about like an\
animated scarecrow. Then suddenly a bland smile illuminated his entire\
face. His long bony finger had caught the end of the bit of string,\
and there he was at it again, just as I had seen him a year ago,\
worrying and fidgeting, making knot upon knot, and untying them again,\
whilst his blue eyes peered at me over the top of his gigantic\
spectacles.\
\
\'93I would like to know what your theory is about the whole thing,\'94 I\
was compelled to say at last; for the case had interested me deeply,\
and, after all, I had come to the A.B.C. shop for the sole purpose of\
discussing the adventures of Cigarette with him.\
\
\'93Oh, my theories are not worth considering,\'94 he said meekly. \'93The\
police would not give me five shillings for any one of them. They\
always prefer a mystery to any logical conclusion, if it is arrived at\
by an outsider. But you may be more lucky. The owner of Cigarette did\
offer \'a3100 reward for the elucidation of the mystery. The noble Earl\
must have backed Cigarette for all he was worth. Malicious tongues go\
even so far as to say that he is practically a ruined man now, and\
that the beautiful Lady Agnes is only too glad to find herself the\
wife of Harold Keeson, the son of the well-known trainer.\
\
\'93If you ever go to Newmarket,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after\
a slight pause, during which he had been absorbed in unravelling one\
of his most complicated knots, \'93any one will point out the Keesons\'92\
house to you. It is called Manor House, and stands in the midst of\
beautiful gardens. Mr. Keeson himself is a man of about fifty, and, as\
a matter of fact, is of very good family, the Keesons having owned\
property in the Midlands for the past eight hundred years. Of this\
fact he is, it appears, extremely proud. His father, however, was a\
notorious spendthrift, who squandered his property, and died in the\
nick of time, leaving his son absolutely penniless and proud as\
Lucifer.\
\
\'93Fate, however, has been kind to George Keeson. His knowledge of\
horses and of all matters connected with the turf stood him in good\
stead; hard work and perseverance did the rest. Now, at fifty years of\
age, he is a very rich man, and practically at the head of a\
profession, which if not exactly that of a gentleman, is, at any rate,\
highly remunerative.\
\
\'93He owns Manor House, and lived there with his young wife and his only\
son and heir, Harold.\
\
\'93It was Mr. Keeson who had trained Cigarette for the Earl of\
Okehampton, and who, of course, had charge of her during her\
apprenticeship, before she was destined to win a fortune for her\
owner, her trainer, and those favoured few who had got wind of her\
capabilities. For Cigarette was to be kept a dark horse\'97not an easy\
matter in these days, when the neighbourhood of every racecourse\
abounds with rascals who eke out a precarious livelihood by various\
methods more or less shady, of which the gleaning of early information\
is perhaps the least disreputable.\
\
\'93Fortunately for Mr. Keeson, however, he had in the groom, Cockram, a\
trusted and valued servant, who had been in his employ for over ten\
years. To say that Cockram took a special pride in Cigarette would be\
but to put it mildly. He positively loved the mare, and I don\'92t think\
that any one ever doubted that his interest in her welfare was every\
bit as keen as that of the Earl of Okehampton or of Mr. Keeson.\
\
\'93It was to Cockram, therefore, that Mr. Keeson entrusted the care of\
Cigarette. She was lodged in the private stables adjoining the Manor\
House, and during the few days immediately preceding the \'91Coronation\
Stakes\'92 the groom practically never left her side, either night or\
day. He slept in the loosebox with her, and ate all his meals in her\
company; nor was any one allowed to come within measurable distance of\
the living treasure, save Mr. Keeson or the Earl of Okehampton\
himself.\
\
\'93And yet, in spite of all these precautions, in spite of every care\
that human ingenuity could devise, on the very morning of the race\
Cigarette was seized with every symptom of poisoning, and although, as\
you say, she is quite herself again now, she was far too ill to fulfil\
her engagement, and, if rumour speaks correctly, completed thereby the\
ruin of the Earl of Okehampton.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
The man in the corner looked at me through his bone-rimmed spectacles,\
and his mild blue eyes gazed pleasantly into mine.\
\
\'93You may well imagine,\'94 he continued, after a while, \'93what a\
thunderbolt such a catastrophe means to those whose hopes of a fortune\
rested upon the fitness of the bay mare. Mr. Keeson lost his temper\
for an instant, they say\'97but for one instant only. When he was hastily\
summoned at six o\'92clock in the morning to Cigarette\'92s stables, and saw\
her lying on the straw, rigid and with glassy eyes, he raised his\
heavy riding-whip over the head of Cockram. Some assert that he\
actually struck him, and that the groom was too wretched and too dazed\
to resent either words or blows. After a good deal of hesitation he\
reluctantly admitted that for the first time since Cigarette had been\
in his charge he had slept long and heavily.\
\
\'93\'91I am such a light sleeper, you know, sir,\'92 he said in a tear-choked\
voice. \'91Usually I could hear every noise the mare made if she stirred\
at all. But there\'97last night I cannot say _what_ happened. I remember\
that I felt rather drowsy after my supper, and must have dropped off\
to sleep very quickly. Once during the night I woke up; the mare was\
all right then.\'92\
\
\'93The man paused, and seemed to be searching for something in his\
mind\'97the recollection of a dream, perhaps. But the veterinary surgeon,\
who was present at the time, having also been hastily summoned to the\
stables, took up the glass which had contained the beer for Cockram\'92s\
supper. He sniffed it, and then tasted it, and said quietly:\
\
\'93\'91No wonder you slept heavily, my man. This beer was drugged: it\
contained opium.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Drugged!\'92 ejaculated Cockram, who, on hearing this fact, which in\
every way exonerated him from blame, seemed more hopelessly wretched\
than he had been before.\
\
\'93It appears that every night Cockram\'92s supper was brought out to him\
in the stables by one of the servants from the Manor House. On this\
particular night Mrs. Keeson\'92s maid, a young girl named Alice Image,\
had brought him a glass of beer and some bread and cheese on a tray at\
about eleven o\'92clock.\
\
\'93Closely questioned by Mr. Keeson, the girl emphatically denied all\
knowledge of any drug in the beer. She had often taken the supper-tray\
across to Cockram, who was her sweetheart, she said. It was usually\
placed ready for her in the hall, and when she had finished attending\
upon her mistress\'92s night toilet she went over to the stables with it.\
She had certainly never touched the beer, and the tray had stood in\
its accustomed place on the hall table looking just the same as usual.\
\'91As if I\'92d go and poison my Cockram!\'92 she said in the midst of a\
deluge of tears.\
\
\'93All these somewhat scanty facts crept into the evening papers that\
same day. That an outrage of a peculiarly daring and cunning character\
had been perpetrated was not for a moment in doubt. So much money had\
been at stake, so many people would be half ruined by it, that even\
the non-racing public at once took the keenest interest in the case.\
All the papers admitted, of course, that for the moment the affair\
seemed peculiarly mysterious, yet all commented upon one fact, which\
they suggested should prove an important clue: this fact was Cockram\'92s\
strange attitude.\
\
\'93At first he had been dazed\'97probably owing to the after-effects of the\
drug; he had also seemed too wretched even to resent Mr. Keeson\'92s very\
natural outburst of wrath. But then, when the presence of the drug in\
his beer was detected, which proved _him_ at any rate, to have been\
guiltless in the matter, his answers, according to all accounts,\
became somewhat confused; and all Mr. Keeson and the \'91vet.,\'92 who were\
present, got out of him after that, was a perpetual ejaculation:\
\'91What\'92s to be done? What\'92s to be done?\'92\
\
\'93Two days later the sporting papers were the first to announce, with\
much glee, that, thanks to the untiring energy of the Scotland Yard\
authorities, daylight seemed at last to have been brought to bear upon\
the mystery which surrounded the dastardly outrage on the Earl of\
Okehampton\'92s mare, Cigarette, and that an important arrest in\
connection with it had already been effected.\
\
\'93It appears that a man named Charles Palk, seemingly of no address,\
had all along been suspected of having at least a hand in the outrage.\
He was believed to be a bookmaker\'92s tout, and was a man upon whom the\
police had long since kept a watchful eye. Palk had been seen loafing\
round the Manor House for the past week, and had been warned off the\
grounds once or twice by the grooms.\
\
\'93It now transpired that on the day preceding the outrage he had hung\
about the neighbourhood of the Manor House the whole afternoon, trying\
to get into conversation with the stable-boys, or even with Mr.\
Keeson\'92s indoor servants. No one, however, would have anything to do\
with him, as Mr. Keeson\'92s orders in those respects were very strict:\
he had often threatened any one of his _employ\'e9s_ with instant\
dismissal if he found him in company with one of these touts.\
\
\'93Detective Twiss, however, who was in charge of the case, obtained the\
information that Alice Image, the maid, had been seen on more than one\
occasion talking to Palk, and that on the very day before the\
Coronation Stakes she had been seen in his company. Closely questioned\
by the detective, Alice Image at first denied her intercourse with the\
tout, but finally was forced to admit that she had held conversation\
with him once or twice.\
\
\'93She was fond of putting a bit now and again upon a horse, but\
Cockram, she added, was such a muff that he never would give her a\
tip, for he did not approve of betting for young women. Palk had\
always been very civil and nice-spoken she further explained.\
Moreover, he came from Buckinghamshire, her own part of the country,\
where she was born; anyway, she had never had cause to regret having\
entrusted a half-sovereign or so of her wages to him.\
\
\'93All these explanations delivered by Alice Image, with the flow of\
tears peculiar to her kind, were not considered satisfactory, and the\
next day she and Charles Palk were both arrested on the charge of\
being concerned in the poisoning of the Earl of Okehampton\'92s mare\
Cigarette, with intent to do her grievous bodily harm.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93These sort of cases,\'94 continued the man in the corner after a slight\
pause, during which his nervous fingers toyed incessantly with that\
eternal bit of string\'97\'93these sort of cases always create a great deal\
of attention amongst the public, the majority of whom in this country\
have very strong sporting proclivities. It was small wonder,\
therefore, when Alice Image and Charles Palk were brought before the\
local magistrates, that the court was crowded to overflowing, both\
with Pressmen and with the general public.\
\
\'93I had all along been very much interested in the case, so I went down\
to Newmarket, and, in spite of the huge crowd, managed to get a good\
seat, whence I could command a full view of the chief personages\
concerned in this thrilling sporting drama.\
\
\'93Firstly, there was the Earl of Okehampton\'97good-looking, but for an\
unmistakable air of the broken-down sporting man about his whole\
person; the trainer, Mr. Keeson\'97a lean, clean-shaven man, with a fine,\
proud carriage, and a general air of ancient lineage and the \'91Domesday\
Booke\'92 about him; Mrs. Keeson\'97a pale, nervous-looking creature, who\
seemed very much out of place in this sporting set; and, finally, the\
accused\'97Alice Image, dissolved in tears, and Charles Palk,\
over-dressed, defiant, horsey, and unsympathetic.\
\
\'93There was also Cockram, the groom. My short-sighted eyes had fastened\
on him the moment I entered the court. A more wretched, miserable,\
bewildered expression I have never seen on any man\'92s face.\
\
\'93Both Alice Image and Charles Palk flatly denied the charge. Alice\
declared, amid a renewed deluge of tears, that she was engaged to be\
married to Cockram, that she \'91no more would have hurt him or the\
pretty creature he was in charge of, for anything.\'92 How could she? As\
for Palk\'97conscious, no doubt, of his own evil reputation\'97he merely\
contented himself with shrugging his shoulders and various denials,\
usually accompanied with emphatic language.\
\
\'93As neither of the accused attempted to deny that they had been\
together the day before the outrage, there was no occasion to call\
witnesses to further prove that fact. Both, however, asserted\
emphatically that their conversation was entirely confined to the\
subject of Alice\'92s proposed flutters on the favourite for the next\
day\'92s race.\
\
\'93Thus the only really important witness was the groom Cockram. Once\
again his attitude as a witness caused a great deal of surprise, and\
gradually, as he gave his evidence in a peculiarly halting and nervous\
manner, that surprise was changed into suspicion.\
\
\'93Questioned by the magistrate, he tried his hardest to exonerate Alice\
from all blame; and yet when asked whether he had cause to suspect any\
one else he became more confused than ever, said, \'91No,\'92 emphatically\
first, then, \'91Yes,\'92 and finally looked round the court appealingly,\
like some poor animal at bay. That the man was hiding something, that\
he was, in point of fact, lying, was apparent to every one. He had\
drunk the beer, he said, unsuspectingly, on that fatal night; he had\
then dropped off to sleep almost immediately, and never woke until\
about six a.m., when a glance at the mare at once told him that there\
was something very wrong.\
\
\'93However, whether Cockram was lying or not\'97whether he suspected any\
one else or was merely trying to shield his sweetheart, there was, in\
the opinion of the magistrate, quite sufficient evidence to prove that\
Alice Image, at any rate, had a hand in the hocussing of Cigarette,\
since it was she who had brought the drugged beer to Cockram. Beyond\
that there was not sufficient evidence to show either that she was a\
tool in the hands of Palk, or that they both were merely instruments\
in the hands of some third person.\
\
\'93Anyway, the magistrate\'97it was Major Laverton, J.P., a great personal\
friend of the Earl of Okehampton, and a remarkably clever and acute\
man\'97tried his hardest to induce Alice to confess. He questioned the\
poor girl so closely and so rigorously that gradually she lost what\
little self-control she had, and every one in the court blamed Major\
Laverton not a little, for he was gradually getting the poor girl into\
a state of hysterics.\
\
\'93As for me, I inwardly commended the learned J.P., for already I had\
guessed what he was driving at, and was not the least astonished when\
the dramatic incident occurred which rendered this case so memorable.\
\
\'93Alice Image, namely, now thoroughly unnerved, harassed with the\
Major\'92s questions, suddenly turned to where Cockram was sitting, and,\
with a hysterical cry, she stretched out both her arms towards him.\
\
\'93\'91Joe! my Joe!\'92 she cried; \'91you know I didn\'92t do it! Can\'92t you do\
anything to help me?\'92\
\
\'93It was pathetic in the extreme: every one in the court felt deeply\
moved. As for Cockram, a sudden change came over him. I am accustomed\
to read the faces of my fellow men, and in that rough countenance I\
saw then emerging, in response to the girl\'92s appeal, a quick and firm\
resolution.\
\
\'93\'91Ay, and I will, Alice!\'92 he said, jumping to his feet. \'91I have tried\
to do my duty. If the gentlemen will hear me I will say all I know.\'92\
\
\'93Needless to say \'91the gentlemen\'92 were only too ready to hear him. Like\
a man who, having made up his mind, is now resolved to act upon it,\
the groom Cockram began his story.\
\
\'93\'91I told your worship that, having drunk the beer that night, I\
dropped off to sleep very fast and very heavy-like. How long I\'92d been\
asleep I couldn\'92t say, when suddenly something seemed not exactly to\
wake me, but to dispel my dreams, so to speak. I opened my eyes, and\
at first I couldn\'92t see anything, as the gas in the stable was turned\
on very low; but I put out my hand to feel the mare\'92s fetlocks, just\
by way of telling her that I was there all right enough, and looking\
after her\'97bless her! At that moment, your worship, I noticed that the\
stable-door was open, and that some one\'97I couldn\'92t see who it was\'97was\
goin\'92 out of it. \'93Who goes there!\'94 says I, for I still felt very\
sleepy and dull, when, to my astonishment, who should reply to me\
but\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93The man paused, and once more over his rough, honest face came the\
old look of perplexity and misery.\
\
\'93\'91But\'97\'97?\'92 queried the magistrate, whose nerves were obviously as much\
on tension as those of every one else in that court.\
\
\'93\'91Speak, Joe\'97won\'92t you?\'92 appealed Alice Image pathetically.\
\
\'93\'91But the mistress\'97Mrs. Keeson, sir,\'92 came from the groom in an almost\
inaudible whisper. \'91You know, ma\'92am,\'92 he added, while the gathering\
tears choked his voice, \'91I wouldn\'92t \'92ave spoke. But she\'92s my\
sweetheart, ma\'92am; and I couldn\'92t bear that the shame should rest on\
her.\'92\
\
\'93There was a moment\'92s deadly silence in that crowded court. Every\
one\'92s eyes wandered towards the pale face of Mrs. Keeson, which,\
however, though almost livid in colour, expressed nothing but the most\
boundless astonishment. As for Mr. Keeson, surprise, incredulity, then\
furious wrath at the slander, could be seen chasing one another upon\
his handsome face.\
\
\'93\'91What lie is this?\'92 burst involuntarily from his lips, as his fingers\
closed more tightly upon the heavy riding-whip which he was holding.\
\
\'93\'91Silence, please!\'92 said the Major with authority. \'91Now, Cockram, go\
on. You say Mrs. Keeson spoke to you. What did she say?\'92\
\
\'93\'91She seemed rather upset, sir,\'92 continued Cockram, still looking with\
humble apology across at his mistress, \'91for she only stammered\
something about: \'93Oh, it\'92s nothing, Cockram. I only wanted to speak to\
my son\'97er\'97to Mr. Harold\'97I\'97\'97\'94\'92\
\
\'93\'91Harold?\'92 thundered Mr. Keeson, who was fast losing his temper.\
\
\'93\'91I must ask you, Mr. Keeson, to be silent,\'92 said the Major. \'91Go on,\
Cockram.\'92\
\
\'93And Cockram continued his narrative:\
\
\'93\'91\'93Mr. Harold, ma\'92am?\'94 I said. \'93What should \'92e be doing \'92ere in the\
stables at this time of night?\'94 \'93Oh, nothing,\'94 says she to me, \'93I\
thought I saw him come in here. I must have been mistaken. Never mind,\
Cockram; it\'92s all right. Good-night.\'94\
\
\'93\'91I said good-night too, and then fell to wondering what Mr. \'92Arold\
could have wanted prowling round the stables at this hour of the\
night. Just then the clock of St. Saviour\'92s struck four o\'92clock, and\
while I was still wondering I fell asleep again, and never awoke till\
six, when the mare was as sick as she could be. And that\'92s the whole\
truth, gentlemen; and I would never have spoke\'97for Mr. and Mrs. Keeson\
have always been good to me, and I\'92d have done anything to save them\
the disgrace\'97but Alice is goin\'92 to be my wife, and I couldn\'92t bear any\
shame to rest upon \'92er.\'92\
\
\'93When Cockram had finished speaking you might have heard a pin drop as\
Major Laverton asked Mrs. Keeson to step into the witness-box. She\
looked fragile and pale but otherwise quite self-possessed, as she\
quietly kissed the book and said in a very firm tone of voice:\
\
\'93\'91I can only say in reply to the extraordinary story which this man\
has just told that the drug in the beer must have given him peculiarly\
vivid dreams. At the hour he names I was in bed fast asleep, as my\
husband can testify; and the whole of Cockram\'92s narrative is a\
fabrication from beginning to end. I may add that I am more than\
willing to forgive him. No doubt his brain was clouded by the opiate;\
and now he is beside himself owing to Alice Image\'92s predicament. As\
for my son Harold, he was absent from home that night; he was spending\
it with some bachelor friends at the \'93Stag and Mantle\'94 hotel in\
Newmarket.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Yes! By the way,\'92 said the magistrate, \'91where is Mr. Harold Keeson?\
I have no doubt that he will be able to give a very good account of\
himself on that memorable night.\'92\
\
\'93\'91My son is abroad, your worship,\'92 said Mrs. Keeson, while a shade of\
a still more livid hue passed over her face.\
\
\'93\'91Abroad, is he?\'92 said the magistrate cheerfully. \'91Well, that settles\
the point satisfactorily for him\'97doesn\'92t it? When did he go?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Last Thursday, your worship,\'92 replied Mrs. Keeson.\
\
\'93Then there was silence again in the court, for that last Thursday was\
the day of the \'91Coronation Stakes\'92\'97the day immediately following the\
memorable night on which the mare Cigarette had been poisoned by an\
unknown hand.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93I doubt whether in all the annals of criminal procedure there ever\
occurred a more dramatic moment than that when so strange a ray of\
daylight was shed on the mysterious outrage on Cigarette. The\
magistrate, having dismissed Mrs. Keeson, hardly dared to look across\
at the trainer, who was a personal friend of his, and who had just\
received such a cruel blow through this terrible charge against his\
only son\'97for at that moment I doubt if there were two people in that\
court who did not think that Mrs. Keeson had just sworn a false oath,\
and that both she and her son had been in the stables that night\'97for\
what purpose only they and their own conscience could tell.\
\
\'93Alice Image and Charles Palk were both discharged; and it is greatly\
to the credit of Cockram that in the midst of his joy in seeing his\
sweetheart safe he still remained very gloomy and upset. As for Mr.\
Keeson, he must have suffered terribly at all this mud cast at his\
only son. He had been wounded in what he worshipped more than anything\
else in the world\'97his family honour. What was the use of money and the\
old estates if such a stain rested upon his name?\
\
\'93As for Mrs. Keeson, public sympathy was very much overshadowed with\
contempt for her stupidity. Had she only held her tongue when Cockram\
challenged her, suspicion would never have fastened upon Harold. The\
fact that she had lied in the witness-box in order to try and remedy\
her blunder was also very severely commented upon. The young man had\
gone abroad on that memorable Thursday accompanied by two of his\
bachelor friends. They had gone on a fishing expedition to Norway, and\
were not expected home for three weeks. As they meant to move from\
place to place they had left no address: letters and telegrams were\
therefore useless.\
\
\'93During those three weeks pending Harold Keeson\'92s return certain facts\
leaked out which did not tend to improve his case. It appears that he\
had long been in love with Lady Agnes Stourcliffe, the daughter of the\
Earl of Okehampton. Some people asserted that the young people were\
actually\'97though secretly\'97engaged. The Earl, however, seems all along\
to have objected to the marriage of his daughter with the son of a\
trainer, and on more than one occasion had remarked that he had not\
sunk quite so low yet as to allow so preposterous a _m\'e9salliance_. Mr.\
Keeson, whose family pride was at least equal to that of the Earl, had\
naturally very much resented this attitude, and had often begged his\
son to give up his pretensions, since they were manifestly so\
unwelcome.\
\
\'93Harold Keeson, however, was deeply in love; and Lady Agnes stuck to\
him with womanly constancy and devotion. Unfortunately a climax was\
reached some days before the disastrous events at Newmarket. The Earl\
of Okehampton suddenly took up a very firm stand on the subject of\
Harold Keeson\'92s courtship of his daughter. Some hot words were\
exchanged between the two men, ending in an open breach, the Earl\
positively forbidding the young man ever to enter his house again.\
\
\'93Harold was terribly unhappy at this turn of events. Pride forbade him\
to take an unfair advantage of a young girl\'92s devotion, and, acting on\
the advice of his parents, he started for his tour in Norway,\
ostensibly in order to try and forget the fair Lady Agnes. This\
unhappy love-affair, ending in an open and bitter quarrel between\
himself and the owner of Cigarette, did\'97as I said before\'97the young\
man\'92s case no good. At the instance of the Earl of Okehampton, who\
determined to prosecute him, he was arrested on landing at Harwich.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93the next events must be\
still fresh in your mind. When Harold Keeson appeared in the dock,\
charged with such meanness as to wreak his private grievance upon a\
dumb animal, public sympathy at once veered round in his favour. He\
looked so handsome, so frank and honest, that at once one felt\
convinced that _his_ hand, at any rate, could never have done such a\
dastardly thing.\
\
\'93Mr. Keeson, who was a rich man, moreover, had enlisted the services\
of Sir Arthur Inglewood, who had, in the short time at his disposal,\
collected all the most important evidence on behalf of his client.\
\
\'93The two young men who had been travelling in Norway with Harold\
Keeson had been present with him on the memorable night at a bachelor\
party given by a mutual friend at the \'91Stag and Mantle.\'92 Both\
testified that the party had played bridge until the small hours of\
the morning, that between two rubbers\'97the rooms being very hot\'97they\
had all strolled out to smoke a cigar in the streets. Just as they\
were about to re-enter the hotel two church clocks\'97one of which was\
St. Saviour\'92s\'97chimed out the hour\'97four o\'92clock.\
\
\'93Four o\'92clock was the hour when Cockram said that he had spoken to\
Mrs. Keeson. Harold had not left the party at the \'91Stag and Mantle\'92\
since ten o\'92clock, which was an hour before Alice Image took the\
drugged beer to the groom. The whole edifice of the prosecution thus\
crumbled together like a house of cards, and Harold Keeson was\
discharged, without the slightest suspicion clinging to him.\
\
\'93Six months later he married Lady Agnes Stourcliffe. The Earl, now a\
completely ruined man, offered no further opposition to the union of\
his daughter with a man who, at any rate, could keep her in comfort\
and luxury; for though both Mr. Keeson and his son lost heavily\
through Cigarette\'92s illness, yet the trainer was sufficiently rich to\
offer his son and his bride a very beautiful home.\'94\
\
The man in the corner called to the waitress, and paid for his glass\
of milk and cheesecake, whilst I remained absorbed in thought, gazing\
at the _Daily Telegraph_, which, in its \'93London Day by Day,\'94 had this\
very morning announced that Mr. and Lady Agnes Keeson had returned to\
town from \'93The Rookery,\'94 Newmarket.\
\
\
\
Chapter V\
\
\'93But who poisoned Cigarette?\'94 I asked after a while; \'93and why?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, who did, I wonder?\'94 he replied with exasperating mildness.\
\
\'93Surely you have a theory,\'94 I suggested.\
\
\'93Ah, but my theories are not worth considering. The police would take\
no notice of them.\'94\
\
\'93Why did Mrs. Keeson go to the stables that night? Did she go?\'94 I\
asked.\
\
\'93Cockram swears she did.\'94\
\
\'93She swears she didn\'92t. If she did why should she have asked for her\
son? Surely she did not wish to incriminate her son in order to save\
herself?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 he replied; \'93women don\'92t save themselves usually at the expense\
of their children, and women don\'92t usually \'91hocus\'92 a horse. It is not\
a female crime at all\'97is it?\'94\
\
The aggravating creature was getting terribly sarcastic; and I began\
to fear that he was not going to speak, after all. He was looking\
dejectedly all around him. I had one or two parcels by me. I undid a\
piece of string from one of them, and handed it to him with the most\
perfectly indifferent air I could command.\
\
\'93I wonder if it was Cockram who told a lie?\'94 I then said\
unconcernedly.\
\
But already he had seized on that bit of string, and, nervously now,\
his long fingers began fashioning a series of complicated knots.\
\
\'93Let us take things from the beginning,\'94 he said at last. \'93The\
beginning of the mystery was the contradictory statements made by the\
groom Cockram and Mrs. Keeson respectively. Let us take, first of all,\
the question of the groom. The matter is simple enough: either he saw\
Mrs. Keeson or he did not. If he did not see her then he must have\
told a lie, either unintentionally or by design\'97unintentionally if he\
was mistaken; but this could not very well be since he asserted that\
Mrs. Keeson spoke to him, and even mentioned her son, Mr. Harold\
Keeson. Therefore, if Cockram did not see Mrs. Keeson he told a lie by\
design for some purpose of his own. You follow me?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 I replied; \'93I have thought all that out for myself already.\'94\
\
\'93Very well. Now, could there be some even remotely plausible motive\
why Cockram should have told that deliberate lie?\'94\
\
\'93To save his sweetheart, Alice Image,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93But you forget that his sweetheart was not accused at first, and\
that, from the very beginning, Cockram\'92s manner, when questioned on\
the subject of the events of that night was strange and contradictory\
in the extreme.\'94\
\
\'93He may have known from the first that Alice Image was guilty,\'94 I\
argued.\
\
\'93In that case he would have merely asserted that he had seen and heard\
nothing during the night, or if he wished to lie about it, he would\
have said that it was Palk, the tout, who sneaked into the stables,\
rather than incriminate his mistress, who had been good and kind to\
him for years.\'94\
\
\'93He may have wished to be revenged on Mrs. Keeson for some reason\
which has not yet transpired.\'94\
\
\'93How? By making a statement which, if untrue, could be so easily\
disproved by Mr. Keeson himself, who, as a matter of fact, could\
easily assert that his wife did not leave her bedroom that night; or\
by incriminating Mr. Harold Keeson, who could prove an _alibi_? Not\
much of a revenge there, you must admit. No, no; the more you reflect\
seriously upon these possibilities the deeper will become your\
conviction that Cockram did not lie either accidentally or on purpose;\
that he did see Mrs. Keeson at that hour at the stable-door; that she\
did speak to him; and that it was she who told the lie in open court.\'94\
\
\'93But,\'94 I asked, feeling more bewildered than before, \'93why should Mrs.\
Keeson have gone to the stables and asked for her son when she must\
have known that he was not there, but that her inquiry would make it,\
to say the least, extremely unpleasant for him?\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94 he shrieked excitedly, jumping up like a veritable\
jack-in-the-box. \'93Ah, if you would only learn to reflect you might in\
time become a fairly able journalist. Why did Mrs. Keeson momentarily\
incriminate her son?\'97for it was only a momentary incrimination. Think,\
think! A woman does not incriminate her child to save herself; but she\
might do it to save some one else\'97some one who was dearer to her than\
that child.\'94\
\
\'93Nonsense!\'94 I protested.\
\
\'93Nonsense, is it?\'94 he replied. \'93You have only to think of the\
characters of the chief personages who figured in the drama\'97of the\
trainer Keeson, with his hasty temper and his inordinate family pride.\
Was it likely when the half-ruined Earl of Okehampton talked of\
_m\'e9salliance_, and forbade the marriage of his daughter with his\
trainer\'92s son that the latter would not resent that insult with\
terrible bitterness? and, resenting it, not think of some means of\
being even with the noble Earl? Can you not imagine the proud man\
boiling with indignation on hearing his son\'92s tale of how Lord\
Okehampton had forbidden him the house? Can you not hear him saying to\
himself:\
\
\'93\'91Well, by \'97\'97 the trainer\'92s son _shall_ marry the Earl\'92s daughter!\'92\
\
\'93And the scheme\'97simple and effectual\'97whereby the ruin of the arrogant\
nobleman would be made so complete that he would be only too willing\
to allow his daughter to marry any one who would give her a good home\
and him a helping hand?\'94\
\
\'93But,\'94 I objected, \'93why should Mr. Keeson take the trouble to drug the\
groom and sneak out to the stables at dead of night when he had access\
to the mare at all hours of the day?\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94 shrieked the animated scarecrow. \'93Why? Because Keeson was just\
one of those clever criminals, with a sufficiency of brains to throw\
police and public alike off the scent. Cockram, remember, spent every\
moment of the day and night with the mare. Therefore, if he had been\
in full possession of his senses and could positively swear that no\
one had had access to Cigarette but his master and himself, suspicion\
was bound to fasten, sooner or later, on Keeson. But Keeson was a bit\
of a genius in the criminal line. Seemingly, he could have had no\
motive for drugging the groom, yet he added that last artistic touch\
to his clever crime, and thus threw a final bucketful of sand in the\
eyes of the police.\'94\
\
\'93Even then,\'94 I argued, \'93Cockram might just have woke up\'97might just\
have caught Keeson in the act.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. And that is, no doubt, what Mrs. Keeson feared.\
\
\'93She was a brave woman, if ever there was one. Can you not picture\
her, knowing her husband\'92s violent temper, his indomitable pride, and\
guessing that he would find some means of being revenged on the Earl\
of Okehampton. Can you not imagine her watching her husband and\
gradually guessing, realising what he had in his mind when, in the\
middle of the night, she saw him steal out of bed and out of the\
house? Can you not see her following him stealthily\'97afraid of him,\
perhaps\'97not daring to interfere\'97terrified above all things of the\
consequences of his crime, of the risks of Cockram waking up, of the\
exposure, the disgrace?\
\
\'93Then the final tableau:\'97Keeson having accomplished his purpose, goes\
back towards the house, and she\'97perhaps with a vague hope that she\
might yet save the mare by taking away the poison which Keeson had\
prepared\'97in her turn goes to the stables. But this time the groom is\
half awake, and challenges her. Then her instinct\'97that unerring\
instinct which always prompts a really good woman when the loved one\
is in danger\'97suggests to Mrs. Keeson the clever subterfuge of\
pretending that she had seen her son entering the stables.\
\
\'93She asks for him, _knowing well that she could do him no harm_ since\
he could so easily prove an _alibi_, but thereby throwing a veritable\
cloud of dust in the eyes of the keenest enquirer, and casting over\
the hocussing of Cigarette so thick a mantle of mystery that\
suspicion, groping blindly round, could never fasten tightly on any\
one.\
\
\'93Think of it all,\'94 he added as, gathering up his hat and umbrella, he\
prepared to go, \'93and remember at the same time that it was Mr. Keeson\
alone who could disprove that his wife never left her room that night,\
that he did not do this, that he guessed what she had done and why she\
had done it, and I think that you will admit that not one link is\
missing in the chain of evidence which I have had the privilege of\
laying before you.\'94\
\
Before I could reply he had gone, and I saw his strange scarecrow-like\
figure disappearing through the glass door. Then I had a good think on\
the subject of the hocussing of Cigarette, and I was reluctantly bound\
to admit that once again the man in the corner had found the only\
possible solution to the mystery.\
\
\
\
III. The Tragedy in Dartmoor Terrace\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93It is not by any means the Law and Police Courts that form the only\
interesting reading in the daily papers,\'94 said the man in the corner\
airily, as he munched his eternal bit of cheesecake and sipped his\
glass of milk, like a frowsy old tom-cat.\
\
\'93You don\'92t agree with me,\'94 he added, for I offered no comment to his\
obvious remark.\
\
\'93No?\'94 I answered. \'93I suppose you were thinking\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Of the tragic death of Mrs. Yule, for instance,\'94 he replied eagerly.\
\'93Beyond the inquest, and its very unsatisfactory verdict, very few\
circumstances connected with that interesting case ever got into the\
papers at all.\'94\
\
\'93I forget what the verdict actually was,\'94 I said, eager, too, on my\
side to hear him talk about that mysterious tragedy, which, as a\
matter of fact, had puzzled a good many people.\
\
\'93Oh, it was as vague and as wordy as the English language would allow.\
The jury found that \'91Mrs. Yule had died through falling downstairs, in\
consequence of a fainting attack, but _how_ she came to fall is not\
clearly shown.\'92\
\
\'93What had happened was this: Mrs. Yule was a rich and eccentric old\
lady, who lived very quietly in a small house in Kensington; No. 9\
Dartmoor Terrace is, I believe, the correct address.\
\
\'93She had no expensive tastes, for she lived, as I said before, very\
simply and quietly in a small Kensington house, with two female\
servants\'97a cook and a housemaid\'97and a young fellow whom she had\
adopted as her son.\
\
\'93The story of this adoption is, of course, the pivot round which all\
the circumstances of the mysterious tragedy revolved. Mrs. Yule,\
namely, had an only son, William, to whom she was passionately\
attached, but, like many a fond mother, she had the desire of mapping\
out that son\'92s future entirely according to her own ideas. William\
Yule, on the other hand, had his own views with regard to his own\
happiness, and one fine day went so far as to marry the girl of his\
choice, and that in direct opposition to his mother\'92s wishes.\
\
\'93Mrs. Yule\'92s chagrin and horror at what she called her son\'92s base\
ingratitude knew no bounds; at first it was even thought that she\
would never get over it.\
\
\'93\'91He has gone in direct opposition to my fondest wishes, and chose a\
wife whom I could never accept as a daughter; he shall have none of\
the property which has enriched me, and which I know he covets.\'92\
\
\'93At first her friends imagined that she meant to leave all her money\
to charitable institutions; but oh! dear me, no! Mrs. Yule was one of\
those women who never did anything that other people expected her to.\
Within three years of her son\'92s marriage she had filled up the place\
which he had vacated, both in her house and in her heart. She had\
adopted a son, preferring, as she said, that her money should benefit\
an individual rather than an institution.\
\
\'93Her choice had fallen upon the only son of a poor man\'97an\
ex-soldier\'97who used to come twice a week to Dartmoor Terrace to tidy\
up the small garden at the back: he was very respectable and very\
honest\'97was born in the same part of England as Mrs. Yule, and had an\
only son whose name happened to be William; he rejoiced in the surname\
of Bloggs.\
\
\'93\'91It suits me in every way,\'92 explained Mrs. Yule to old Mr. Statham,\
her friend and solicitor. \'91You see, I am used to the name of William,\
and the boy is nice-looking and has done very well at the Board\
School. Moreover, old Bloggs will die within a year or two, and\
William will be left without any encumbrances.\'92\
\
\'93Herein Mrs. Yule\'92s prophecy proved to be correct. Old Bloggs did die\
very soon, and his son was duly adopted by the rich and eccentric old\
lady, sent to a good school, and finally given a berth in the Union\
Bank.\
\
\'93I saw young Bloggs\'97it is not a euphonious name, is it?\'97at that\
memorable inquest later on. He was very young and unassuming, and used\
to keep very much out of the way of Mrs. Yule\'92s friends, who, mind\
you, strongly disapproved of his presence in the rich old widow\'92s\
house, to the detriment of the only legitimate son and heir.\
\
\'93What happened within the intimate and close circle of 9, Dartmoor\
Terrace, during the next three years of course nobody can tell.\
Certain it is that by the time young Bloggs was nearing his\
twenty-first birthday, he had become the very apple of his adopted\
mother\'92s eye.\
\
\'93During those three years Mr. Statham and other old friends had worked\
hard in the interests of William Yule. Every one felt that the latter\
was being very badly treated indeed. He had studied painting in his\
younger days, and now had set up a small studio in Hampstead, and was\
making perhaps a couple of hundred or so a year, and that, with much\
difficulty, whilst the gardener\'92s son had supplanted him in his\
mother\'92s affections, and, worse still, in his mother\'92s purse.\
\
\'93The old lady was more obdurate than ever. In deference to the strong\
feelings of her friends she had agreed to see her son occasionally,\
and William Yule would call upon his mother from time to time\'97in the\
middle of the day when Bloggs was out of the way at the Bank\'97stay to\
tea, and part from her in frigid, though otherwise amicable, terms.\
\
\'93\'91I have no ill-feeling against my son,\'92 the old lady would say, \'91but\
when he married against my wishes, he became a stranger to me\'97that is\
all\'97a stranger, however, whose pleasant acquaintanceship I am pleased\
to keep up.\'92\
\
\'93That the old lady meant to carry her eccentricities in this respect\
to the bitter end, became all the more evident when she sent for her\
old friend and lawyer, Mr. Statham, and explained to him that she\
wished to make over to young Bloggs the whole of her property by deed\
of gift, during her lifetime\'97on condition that on his twenty-first\
birthday he legally took up the name of Yule.\
\
\'93Mr. Statham subsequently made public, as you know, the whole of this\
interview which he had with Mrs. Yule.\
\
\'93\'91I tried to dissuade her, of course,\'92 he said, \'91for I thought it so\
terribly unfair on William Yule and his children. Moreover, I had\
always hoped that when Mrs. Yule grew older and more feeble she would\
surely relent towards her only son. But she was terribly obstinate.\'92\
\
\'93\'91It is because I may become weak in my dotage,\'92 she said, \'91that I\
want to make the whole thing absolutely final\'97I don\'92t want to relent.\
I wish that William should suffer, where I think he will suffer most,\
for he was always over fond of money. If I make a will in favour of\
Bloggs, who knows I might repent it, and alter it at the eleventh\
hour? One is apt to become maudlin when one is dying, and has people\
weeping all round one. No!\'97I want the whole thing to be absolutely\
irrevocable; and I shall present the deed of gift to young Bloggs on\
his twenty-first birthday. I can always make it a condition that he\
keeps me in moderate comfort to the end of my days. He is too big a\
fool to be really ungrateful, and after all I don\'92t think I should\
very much mind ending my life in the workhouse.\'92\
\
\'93\'91What could I do?\'92 added Mr. Statham. \'91If I had refused to draw up\
that iniquitous deed of gift, she only would have employed some other\
lawyer to do it for her. As it is, I secured an annuity of \'a3500 a year\
for the old lady, in consideration of a gift worth some \'a330,000 made\
over absolutely to Mr. William Bloggs.\'92\
\
\'93The deed was drawn up,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93there is no\
doubt of that. Mr. Statham saw to it. The old lady even insisted on\
having two more legal opinions upon it, lest there should be the\
slightest flaw that might render the deed invalid. Moreover, she\
caused herself to be examined by two specialists in order that they\
might testify that she was absolutely sound in mind, and in full\
possession of all her faculties.\
\
\'93When the deed was all that the law could wish, Mr. Statham handed it\
over to Mrs. Yule, who wished to keep it by her until 3rd April\'97young\
Bloggs\'92 twenty-first birthday\'97on which day she meant to surprise him\
with it.\
\
\'93Mr. Statham handed over the deed to Mrs. Yule on 14th February, and\
on 28th March\'97that is to say, six days before Bloggs\'92 majority\'97the old\
lady was found dead at the foot of the stairs in Dartmoor Terrace,\
whilst her desk was found to have been broken open, and the deed of\
gift had disappeared.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93From the very first the public took a very great interest in the sad\
death of Mrs. Yule. The old lady\'92s eccentricities were pretty well\
known throughout all her neighbourhood, at any rate. Then, she had a\
large circle of friends, who all took sides, either for the disowned\
son or for the old lady\'92s rigid and staunch principles of filial\
obedience.\
\
\'93Directly, therefore, that the papers mentioned the sudden death of\
Mrs. Yule, tongues began to wag, and, whilst some asserted \'91Accident,\'92\
others had already begun to whisper \'91Murder.\'92\
\
\'93For the moment nothing definite was known. Mr. Bloggs had sent for\
Mr. Statham, and the most persevering and most inquisitive persons of\
both sexes could glean no information from the cautious old lawyer.\
\
\'93The inquest was to be held on the following day, and perforce\
curiosity had to be bridled until then. But you may imagine how that\
coroner\'92s court at Kensington was packed on that day. I, of course,\
was at my usual place\'97well to the front\'97for I was already keenly\
interested in the tragedy, and knew that a palpitating mystery lurked\
behind the old lady\'92s death.\
\
\'93Annie, the housemaid at Dartmoor Terrace, was the first, and I may\
say the only really important witness during that interesting inquest.\
The story she told amounted to this: Mrs. Yule, it appears, was very\
religious, and, in spite of her advancing years and decided weakness\
of the heart, was in the habit of going to early morning service every\
day of her life at six o\'92clock. She would get up before any one else\
in the house, and winter or summer, rain, snow, or fine, she would\
walk round to St. Matthias\'92 Church, coming home at about a quarter to\
seven, just when her servants were getting up.\
\
\'93On this sad morning (28th March) Annie explained that she got up as\
usual and went downstairs (the servants slept at the top of the house)\
at seven o\'92clock. She noticed nothing wrong, her mistress\'92s bedroom\
door was open as usual, Annie merely remarking to herself that the\
mistress was later than usual from church that morning. Then suddenly,\
in the hall at the foot of the stairs, she caught sight of Mrs. Yule\
lying head downwards, her head on the mat, motionless.\
\
\'93\'91I ran downstairs as quickly as I could,\'92 continued Annie, \'91and I\
suppose I must \'92ave screamed, for cook came out of \'92er room upstairs,\
and Mr. Bloggs, too, shouted down to know what was the matter. At\
first we thought Mrs. Yule was unconscious-like. Me and Mr. Bloggs\
carried \'92er to \'92er room, and then Mr. Bloggs ran for the doctor.\'92\
\
\'93The rest of Annie\'92s story,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93was\
drowned in a deluge of tears. As for the doctor, he could add but\
little to what the public had already known and guessed. Mrs. Yule\
undoubtedly suffered from a weak heart, although she had never been\
known to faint. In this instance, however, she undoubtedly must have\
turned giddy, as she was about to go downstairs, and fallen headlong.\
She was of course very much injured, the doctor explained, but she\
actually died of heart failure, brought on by the shock of the fall.\
She must have been on her way to church, for her prayer book was found\
on the floor close by her, also a candle\'97which she must have carried,\
as it was a dark morning\'97had rolled along and extinguished itself as\
it rolled. From these facts, therefore, it was gathered that the poor\
old lady came by this tragic death at about six o\'92clock, the hour at\
which she regularly started out for morning service. Both the servants\
and also Mr. Bloggs slept at the top of the house, and it is a known\
fact that sleep in most cases is always heaviest in the early morning\
hours; there was, therefore, nothing strange in the fact that no one\
heard either the fall or a scream, if Mrs. Yule uttered one, which is\
doubtful.\
\
\'93So far, you see,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after a slight\
pause, \'93there did not appear to be anything very out of the way or\
mysterious about Mrs. Yule\'92s tragic death. But the public expected\
interesting developments, and I must say their expectations were more\
than fully realised.\
\
\'93Jane, the cook, was the first witness to give the public an inkling\
of the sensations to come.\
\
\'93She deposed that on Thursday, the 27th, she was alone in the kitchen\
in the evening after dinner, as it was the housemaid\'92s evening out,\
when, at about nine o\'92clock, there was a ring at the bell.\
\
\'93\'91I went to answer the door,\'92 said Jane, \'91and there was a lady, all\
dressed in black, as far as I could see\'97as the \'92all gas always did\
burn very badly\'97still, I think she was dressed dark, and she \'92ad on a\
big \'92at and a veil with spots. She says to me: \'93Mrs. Yule lives \'92ere?\'94\
I says, \'93She do, \'92m,\'94 though I don\'92t think she was quite the lady, so\
I don\'92t know why I said \'92m, but\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93\'91Yes, yes!\'92 here interrupted the coroner somewhat impatiently, \'91it\
doesn\'92t matter what you said. Tell us what happened.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Yes, sir,\'92 continued Jane, quite undisturbed, \'91as I was saying, I\
asked the lady her name, and she says: \'93Tell Mrs. Yule I would wish to\
speak with her,\'94 then as she saw me \'92esitating, for I didn\'92t like\
leaving her all alone in the \'92all, she said, \'93Tell Mrs. Yule that Mrs.\
William Yule wishes to speak with \'92er.\'94\'92\
\
\'93Jane paused to take breath, for she talked fast and volubly, and all\
eyes were turned to a corner of the room, where William Yule, dressed\
in the careless fashion affected by artists, sat watching and\
listening eagerly to everything that was going on. At the mention of\
his wife\'92s name he shrugged his shoulders, and I thought for the\
moment that he would jump up and say something; but he evidently\
thought better of it, and remained as before, silent and quietly\
watching.\
\
\'93\'91You showed the lady upstairs?\'92 asked the coroner, after an instant\'92s\
most dramatic pause.\
\
\'93\'91Yes, sir,\'92 replied Jane; \'91but I went to ask the mistress first. Mrs.\
Yule was sitting in the drawing-room, reading. She says to me, \'93Show\
the lady up at once; and, Jane,\'94 she says, \'93ask Mr. Bloggs to kindly\
come to the drawing-room.\'94 I showed the lady up, and I told Mr.\
Bloggs, who was smoking in the library, and \'92e went to the\
drawing-room.\
\
\'93\'91When Annie come in,\'92 continued Jane with increased volubility, \'91I\
told \'92er \'92oo \'92ad come, and she and me was very astonished, because we\
\'92ad often seen Mr. William Yule come to see \'92is mother, but we \'92ad\
never seen \'92is wife. \'93Did you see what she was like cook?\'94 says Annie\
to me. \'93No,\'94 I says, \'93the \'92all gas was burnin\'92 that badly, and she \'92ad\
a veil on.\'94 Then Annie ups and says, \'93I must go up, cook,\'94 she says,\
\'93for my things is all wet. I never did see such rain in all my life. I\
tell you my boots and petticoats is all soaked through.\'94 Then up she\
runs, and I thought then that per\'92aps she meant to see if she couldn\'92t\
\'92ear anything that was goin\'92 on upstairs. Presently she come down\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93But at this point Jane\'92s flow of eloquence received an unexpected\
check. The coroner preferred to hear from Annie herself whatever the\
latter may have overheard, and Jane, very wrathful and indignant, had\
to stand aside, while Annie, who was then recalled, completed the\
story.\
\
\'93\'91I don\'92t know what made me stop on the landing,\'92 she explained\
timidly, \'91and I\'92m sure I didn\'92t mean to listen. I was going upstairs\
to change my things, and put on my cap and apron, in case the mistress\
wanted anything.\
\
\'93\'91Then, I don\'92t think I ever \'92eard Mrs. Yule\'92s voice so loud and\
angry.\'92\
\
\'93\'91You stopped to listen?\'92 asked the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91I couldn\'92t help it, sir. Mrs. Yule was shouting at the top of \'92er\
voice. \'93Out of my house,\'94 she says; \'93I never wish to see you or your\
precious husband inside my doors again.\'94\'92\
\
\'93\'91You are quite sure that you heard those very words?\'92 asked the\
coroner earnestly.\
\
\'93\'91I\'92ll take my Bible oath on every one of them, sir,\'92 said Annie\
emphatically. \'91Then I could \'92ear some one crying and moaning: \'93Oh!\
what have I done? Oh! what have I done?\'94 I didn\'92t like to stand on the\
landing then, for fear some one should come out, so I ran upstairs,\
and put on my cap and apron, for I was all in a tremble, what with\
what I\'92d heard, and the storm outside, which was coming down terrible.\
\
\'93\'91When I went down again, I \'92ardly durst stand on the landing, but the\
door of the drawing-room was ajar, and I \'92eard Mr. Bloggs say: \'93Surely\
you will not turn a human being, much less a woman, out on a night\
like this?\'94 And the mistress said, still speaking very angrily: \'93Very\
well, you may sleep here; but remember, I don\'92t wish to see your face\
again. I go to church at six and come home again at seven; mind you\
are out of the house before then. There are plenty of trains after\
seven o\'92clock.\'94\'92\
\
\'93After that,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93Mrs. Yule rang for the\
housemaid and gave orders that the spare-room should be got ready, and\
that the visitor should have some tea and toast brought to her in the\
morning as soon as Annie was up.\
\
\'93But Annie was rather late on that eventful morning of the 28th. She\
did not go downstairs till seven o\'92clock. When she did, she found her\
mistress lying dead at the foot of the stairs. It was not until after\
the doctor had been and gone that both the servants suddenly\
recollected the guest in the spare room. Annie knocked at her door,\
and, receiving no answer, she walked in; the bed had not been slept\
in, and the spare room was empty.\
\
\'93\'91There, now!\'92 was the housemaid\'92s decisive comment, \'91me and cook did\
\'92ear some one cross the \'92all, and the front door bang about an hour\
after every one else was in bed.\'92\
\
\'93Presumably, therefore, Mrs. William Yule had braved the elements and\
left the house at about midnight, leaving no trace behind her, save\
perhaps the broken lock of the desk that had held the deed of gift in\
favour of young Bloggs.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93Some say there\'92s a Providence that watches over us,\'94 said the man in\
the corner, when he had looked at me keenly, and had assured himself\
that I was really interested in his narrative, \'93others use the less\
poetic and more direct formula, that \'91the devil takes care of his\
own.\'92 The impression of the general public during this interesting\
coroner\'92s inquest was that the devil was taking special care of his\
own\'97(\'91his own\'92 being in this instance represented by Mrs. William\
Yule, who, by the way, was not present).\
\
\'93What the Evil One had done for her was this: He caused the hall gas\
to burn so badly on that eventful Thursday night, 27th March, that\
Jane, the cook, had not been able to see Mrs. William Yule at all\
distinctly. He, moreover, decreed that when Annie went into the\
drawing-room later on to take her mistress\'92s orders, with regard to\
the spare room, Mrs. William was apparently dissolved in tears, for\
she only presented the back of her head to the inquisitive glances of\
the young housemaid.\
\
\'93After that the two servants went to bed, and heard some one cross the\
hall and leave the house about an hour or so later; but neither of\
them could swear positively that they would recognise the mysterious\
visitor if they set eyes on her again.\
\
\'93Throughout all these proceedings, however, you may be sure that Mr.\
William Yule did not remain a passive spectator. In fact I, who\
watched him, could see quite clearly that he had the greatest possible\
difficulty in controlling himself. Mind you, I knew by then exactly\
where the hitch lay, and I could, and will presently, tell you exactly\
all that occurred on Thursday evening, 27th March, at No. 9, Dartmoor\
Terrace, just as if I had spent that memorable night there myself; and\
I can assure you that it gave me great pleasure to watch the faces of\
the two men most interested in the verdict of this coroner\'92s jury.\
\
\'93Every one\'92s sympathy had by now entirely veered round to young\
Bloggs, who for years had been brought up to expect a fortune, and had\
then, at the last moment, been defrauded of it, through what looked\
already much like a crime. The deed of gift had, of course, not been\
what the lawyers call \'91completed.\'92 It had rested in Mrs. Yule\'92s desk,\
and had never been \'91delivered\'92 by the donor to the donee, or even to\
another person on his behalf.\
\
\'93Young Bloggs, therefore, saw himself suddenly destined to live his\
life as penniless as he had been when he was still the old gardener\'92s\
son.\
\
\'93No doubt the public felt that what lurked mostly in his mind was a\
desire for revenge, and I think everyone forgave him when he gave his\
evidence with a distinct tone of animosity against the woman who had\
apparently succeeded in robbing him of a fortune.\
\
\'93He had only met Mrs. William Yule once before, he explained, but he\
was ready to swear that it was she who called that night. As for the\
original motive of the quarrel between the two ladies, young Bloggs\
was inclined to think that it was mostly on the question of money.\
\
\'93\'91Mrs. William,\'92 continued the young man, \'91made certain peremptory\
demands on Mrs. Yule, which the old lady bitterly resented.\'92\
\
\'93But here there was an awful and sudden interruption. William Yule,\
now quite beside himself with rage, had with one bound reached the\
witness-box, and struck young Bloggs a violent blow in the face.\
\
\'93\'91Liar and cheat!\'92 he roared, \'91take that!\'92\
\
\'93And he prepared to deal the young man another even more vigorous\
blow, when he was overpowered and seized by the constables. Young\
Bloggs had become positively livid; his face looked grey and ashen,\
except there, where his powerful assailant\'92s fist had left a deep\
purple mark.\
\
\'93\'91You have done your wife\'92s cause no good,\'92 remarked the coroner\
drily, as William Yule, sullen and defiant, was forcibly dragged back\
to his place. \'91I shall adjourn the inquest until Monday, and will\
expect Mrs. Yule to be present and to explain exactly what happened\
after her quarrel with the deceased, and why she left the house so\
suddenly and mysteriously that night.\'92\
\
\'93William Yule tried an explanation even then. His wife had never left\
the studio in Sheriff Road, West Hampstead, the whole of that Thursday\
evening. It was a fearfully stormy night, and she never went outside\
the door. But the Yules kept no servant at the cheap little rooms; a\
charwoman used to come in every morning only for an hour or two, to do\
the rough work; there was no one, therefore, except the husband\
himself to prove Mrs. William Yule\'92s _alibi_.\
\
\'93At the adjourned inquest, on the Monday, Mrs. William Yule duly\
appeared; she was a young, delicate-looking woman, with a patient and\
suffering face, that had not an atom of determination or vice in it.\
\
\'93Her evidence was very simple; she merely swore solemnly that she had\
spent the whole evening indoors, she had never been to 9, Dartmoor\
Terrace, in her life, and, as a matter of fact, would never have dared\
to call on her irreconcilable mother-in-law. Neither she nor her\
husband were specially in want of money either.\
\
\'93\'91My husband had just sold a picture at the Water Colour Institute,\'92\
she explained, \'91we were not hard up; and certainly I should never have\
attempted to make the slightest demand on Mrs. Yule.\'92\
\
\'93There the matter had to rest with regard to the theft of the\
document, for that was no business of the coroner\'92s or of the jury.\
According to medical evidence the old lady\'92s death had been due to a\
very natural and possible accident\'97a sudden feeling of giddiness\'97and\
the verdict had to be in accordance with this.\
\
\'93There was no real proof against Mrs. William Yule\'97only one man\'92s\
word, that of young Bloggs; and it would no doubt always have been\
felt that his evidence might not be wholly unbiased. He was therefore\
well advised not to prosecute. The world was quite content to believe\
that the Yules had planned and executed the theft, but he never would\
have got a conviction against Mrs. William Yule just on his own\
evidence.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93Then William Yule and his wife were left in full possession of their\
fortune?\'94 I asked eagerly.\
\
\'93Yes, they were,\'94 he replied; \'93but they had to go and travel abroad\
for a while, feeling was so high against them. The deed of course, not\
having been \'91delivered,\'92 could not be upheld in a court of law; that\
was the opinion of several eminent counsel whom Mr. Statham, with a\
lofty sense of justice, consulted on behalf of young Bloggs.\'94\
\
\'93And young Bloggs was left penniless?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said the man in the corner, as, with a weird and satisfied\
smile, he pulled a piece of string out of his pocket; \'93the friends of\
the late Mrs. Yule subscribed the sum of \'a31,000 for him, for they all\
thought he had been so terribly badly treated, and Mr. Statham has\
taken him in his office as articled pupil. No! no! young Bloggs has\
not done so badly either\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93What seems strange to me,\'94 I remarked \'93is that for all she knew, Mrs.\
William Yule might have committed only a silly and purposeless theft.\
If Mrs. Yule had not died suddenly and accidentally the next morning,\
she would, no doubt, have executed a fresh deed of gift, and all would\
have been _in statu quo_.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 he replied drily, whilst his fingers fidgeted nervously\
with his bit of string.\
\
\'93Of course,\'94 I suggested, for I felt that the funny creature wanted\
to be drawn out; \'93she may have reckoned on the old lady\'92s weak\
heart, and the shock to her generally, but it was, after all, very\
problematical.\'94\
\
\'93Very,\'94 he said, \'93and surely you are not still under the impression\
that Mrs. Yule\'92s death was purely the result of an accident?\'94\
\
\'93What else could it be?\'94 I urged.\
\
\'93The result of a slight push from the top of the stairs,\'94 he remarked\
placidly, whilst a complicated knot went to join a row of its fellows.\
\
\'93But Mrs. William Yule had left the house before midnight\'97or, at any\
rate, some one had. Do you think she had an accomplice?\'94\
\
\'93I think,\'94 he said excitedly, \'93that the mysterious visitor who left\
the house that night had an instigator whose name was William Bloggs.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t understand,\'94 I gasped in amazement.\
\
\'93Point No. 1,\'94 he shrieked, while the row of knots followed each other\
in rapid succession, \'93young Bloggs swore a lie when he swore that it\
was Mrs. William Yule who called at Dartmoor Terrace that night.\'94\
\
\'93What makes you say that,\'94 I retorted.\
\
\'93One very simple fact,\'94 he replied, \'93so simple that it was, of course,\
overlooked. Do you remember that one of the things which Annie\
overheard was old Mrs. Yule\'92s irate words, \'91Very well, you may sleep\
here; but, remember, I do not wish to see your face again. You can\
leave my house before I return from church; you can get plenty of\
trains after seven o\'92clock.\'92 Now what do you make of that?\'94 he added\
triumphantly.\
\
\'93Nothing in particular,\'94 I rejoined; \'93it was an awfully wet night,\
and\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93And High Street, Kensington Station, within two minutes\'92 walk of\
Dartmoor Terrace, with plenty of trains to West Hampstead, and Sheriff\
Road within two minutes of this latter station,\'94 he shrieked, getting\
more and more excited, \'93and the hour only about ten o\'92clock, when\
there _are_ plenty of trains from one part of London to another? Old\
Mrs. Yule, with her irascible temper and obstinate ways, would have\
said: \'91There\'92s the station, not two minutes\'92 walk, get out of my\
house, and don\'92t ever let me see your face again,\'92 wouldn\'92t she now?\'94\
\
\'93It certainly seems more likely.\'94\
\
\'93Of course it does. She only allowed the woman to stay because the\
woman had either a very long way to go to get a train, or perhaps had\
missed her last train\'97a connection on a branch line presumably\'97and\
could not possibly get home at all that night.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, that sounds logical,\'94 I admitted.\
\
\'93Point No. 2,\'94 he shrieked, \'93young Bloggs having told a lie, had some\
object in telling it. That was my starting point; from there I worked\
steadily until I had reconstructed the events of that Thursday\
night\'97nay, more, until I knew something more about young Bloggs\'92\
immediate future, in order that I might then imagine his past.\
\
\'93And this is what I found.\
\
\'93After the tragic death of Mrs. Yule, young Bloggs went abroad at the\
expense of some kind friends, and came home with a wife, whom he is\
supposed to have met and married in Switzerland. From that point\
everything became clear to me. Young Bloggs had told a lie when he\
swore that it was Mrs. William Yule; therefore it was somebody who\
either represented herself as such, or who believed herself to be Mrs.\
William Yule.\
\
\'93The first supposition,\'94 continued the funny creature, \'93I soon\
dismissed as impossible; young Bloggs knew Mrs. William Yule by\
sight\'97and since he had lied, he had done so deliberately. Therefore to\
my mind the lady who called herself Mrs. William Yule did so because\
she believed that she had a right to that name; that she had married a\
man, who, for purposes of his own, had chosen to call himself by that\
name. From this point to that of guessing who that man was was simple\
enough.\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean young Bloggs himself?\'94 I asked in amazement.\
\
\'93And whom else?\'94 he replied. \'93Isn\'92t that sort of thing done every day?\
Bloggs was a hideous name, and Yule was eventually to be his own. With\
William Yule\'92s example before him, he must have known that it would be\
dangerous to broach the marriage question at all before the old lady,\
and probably only meant to wait for a favourable opportunity of doing\
so. But after a while the young wife would naturally become troubled\
and anxious, and like most women under the same circumstances, would\
become jealous and inquisitive as well.\
\
\'93She soon found out where he lived, and no doubt called there,\
thinking that old Mrs. Yule was her husband\'92s own fond mother.\
\
\'93You can picture the rest. Mrs. Yule, furious at having been deceived,\
herself destroys the deed of gift which she meant to present to her\
adopted son, and from that hour young Bloggs sees himself penniless.\
\
\'93The false Mrs. Yule left the house, and young Bloggs waited for his\
opportunity on the dark landing of a small London house. One push and\
the deed was done. With her weak heart, Mrs. Yule was sure to die of\
the shock, if not of the fall.\
\
\'93Before that, already the desk had been broken open and every\
appearance of a theft given to it. After the tragedy, then, young\
Bloggs retired quietly to his room. The whole thing looked so like an\
accident that, even had the servants heard the fall at once, there\
would still have been time enough for the young villain to sneak into\
his room, and then to reappear at his door as if he, too, had been\
just awakened by the noise.\
\
\'93The result turned out just as he had expected. The William Yules have\
been and still are suspected of the theft; and young Bloggs is a hero\
of romance with whom every one is in sympathy.\'94\
\
\
\
IV. Who Stole the Black Diamonds?\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93Do you know who that is?\'94 said the man in the corner, as he pushed a\
small packet of photos across the table.\
\
The picture on the top represented an entrancingly beautiful woman,\
with bare arms and neck, and a profusion of pearl and diamond\
ornaments about her head and throat.\
\
\'93Surely this is the Queen of\'97\'97?\'94\
\
\'93Hush!\'94 he broke in abruptly, with mock dismay; \'93you must mention no\
names.\'94\
\
\'93Why not?\'94 I asked, laughing, for he looked so droll in his distress.\
\
\'93Look closely at the photo,\'94 he replied, \'93and at the necklace and\
tiara that the lady is wearing.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 I said. \'93Well?\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean to say you don\'92t recognise them?\'94\
\
I looked at the picture more closely, and then there suddenly came\
back to my mind that mysterious story of the Black Diamonds, which had\
not only bewildered the police of Europe, but also some of its\
diplomats.\
\
\'93Ah! I see you do recognise the jewels!\'94 said the funny creature,\
after a while. \'93No wonder! for their design is unique, and photographs\
of that necklace and tiara were circulated practically throughout the\
world.\
\
\'93Of course I am not going to mention names, for you know very well who\
the royal heroes of this mysterious adventure were. For the purposes\
of my narrative, suppose I call them the King and Queen of \'91Bohemia.\'92\
\
\'93The value of the stones was said to be fabulous, and it was only\
natural when the King of \'91Bohemia\'92 found himself somewhat in want of\
money\'97a want which has made itself felt before now with even the most\
powerful European monarchs\'97that he should decide to sell the precious\
trinkets, worth a small kingdom in themselves. In order to be in\
closer touch with the most likely customers, their Majesties of\
\'91Bohemia\'92 came over to England during the season of 1902\'97a season\
memorable alike for its deep sorrow and its great joy.\
\
\'93After the sad postponement of the Coronation festivities, they rented\
Eton Chase, a beautiful mansion just outside Chislehurst, for the\
summer months. There they entertained right royally, for the Queen was\
very gracious and the King a real sportsman\'97there also the rumour\
first got about that His Majesty had decided to sell the world-famous\
_parure_ of Black Diamonds.\
\
\'93Needless to say, they were not long in the market: quite a host of\
American millionaires had already coveted them for their wives, and\
brisk and sensational offers were made to His Majesty\'92s business man\
both by letter and telegram.\
\
\'93At last, however, Mr. Wilson, the multi-millionaire, was understood\
to have made an offer, for the necklace and tiara, of \'a3500,000, which\
had been accepted.\
\
\'93But a very few days later, that is to say, on the Sunday and Monday,\
6th and 7th July, there appeared in the papers the short but deeply\
sensational announcement that a burglary had occurred at Eton Chase,\
Chislehurst, the mansion inhabited by Their Majesties the King and\
Queen of \'91Bohemia\'92; and that among the objects stolen was the famous\
_parure_ of Black Diamonds, for which a bid of half a million sterling\
had just been made and accepted.\
\
\'93The burglary had been one of the most daring and most mysterious ones\
ever brought under the notice of the police authorities. The mansion\
was full of guests at the time, among whom were many diplomatic\
notabilities, and also Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, the future owners of the\
gems; there were also a very large staff of servants. The burglary\
must have occurred between the hours of 10 and 11.30 p.m., though the\
precise moment could not be ascertained.\
\
\'93The house itself stands in the midst of a large garden, and has deep\
French windows opening out upon a terrace at the back. There are\
ornamental iron balconies to the windows of the upper floors, and it\
was to one of these, situated immediately above the dining-room, that\
a rope-ladder was found to be attached.\
\
\'93The burglar must have chosen a moment when the guests were dispersed\
in the smoking, billiard, and drawing-rooms; the servants were having\
their own meal, and the dining-room was deserted. He must have swung\
his rope-ladder, and entered Her Majesty\'92s own bedroom by the window\
which\'97as the night was very warm\'97had been left open. The jewels were\
locked up in a small iron box, which stood upon the dressing-table,\
and the burglar took the box bodily away with him, and then, no doubt,\
returned the way he came.\
\
\'93The wonderful point in this daring attempt was the fact that most of\
the windows on the ground floor were slightly open that night, that\
the rooms themselves were filled with guests, and that the dining-room\
was not empty for more than a few minutes at a time, as the servants\
were still busy clearing away after dinner.\
\
\'93At nine o\'92clock some of the younger guests had strolled out on to the\
terrace, and the last of these returned to the drawing-room at ten\
o\'92clock; at half-past eleven one of the servants caught sight of the\
rope-ladder in front of one of the dining-room windows, and the alarm\
was given.\
\
\'93All traces of the burglar, however, and of his princely booty had\
completely disappeared.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93Not only did this daring burglary cause a great deal of excitement,\'94\
continued the man in the corner, \'93but it also roused a good deal of\
sympathy in the public mind for the King and Queen of \'91Bohemia\'92 who\
thus found their hope of raising half a million sterling suddenly\
dashed to the ground. The loss to them would, of course, be\
irreparable.\
\
\'93Matters, were, however, practically at a standstill, all enquiries\
from enterprising journalists only eliciting the vague information\
that the police \'91held a clue.\'92 We all know what that means. Then all\
at once a wonderful rumour got about.\
\
\'93Goodness only knows how these rumours originate\'97sometimes solely in\
the imagination of the man in the street. In this instance certainly,\
that worthy gentleman had a very sensational theory. It was namely\
rumoured all over London that the clue which the police held pointed\
to no less a person than Mr. Wilson himself.\
\
\'93What had happened was this: Minute enquiries on the part of the most\
able detectives of Scotland Yard had brought to light the fact that\
the burglary at Eton Chase must have occurred precisely between ten\
minutes and a quarter past eleven; at every other moment of the entire\
evening somebody or other had observed either the terrace or the\
dining-room windows.\
\
\'93I told you that until ten o\'92clock some of Their Majesties\'92 guests\
were walking up and down the terrace; between ten and half-past\
servants were clearing away in the dining-room, and here it was\
positively ascertained beyond any doubt that no burglar could have\
slung a rope-ladder and climbed up it immediately outside those\
windows, for one or other of the six servants engaged in clearing away\
the dinner must of necessity have caught sight of him.\
\
\'93At half-past ten John Lucas, the head gardener, was walking through\
the gardens with a dog at his heels, and did not get back to the lodge\
until just upon eleven. He certainly did not go as far as the terrace,\
and as that side of the house was in shadow he could not say\
positively whether the ladder was there or not, but he certainly did\
assert most emphatically that there was no burglar about the _grounds_\
then, for the dog was a good watch-dog and would have barked if any\
stranger was about. Lucas took the dog in with him and gave him a bit\
of supper, and only fastened him to his kennel outside at a\
quarter-past eleven.\
\
\'93Surmising, therefore, that at half-past ten, when John Lucas started\
on his round, the deed was not yet done, that quarter of an hour would\
give the burglar the only possible opportunity of entering the\
premises _from the outside_, without being barked at by the dog. Now,\
during most of that same quarter of an hour, His Majesty the King of\
\'91Bohemia\'92 himself had retired into a small library with his private\
secretary, in order to glance through certain despatches which had\
arrived earlier in the evening.\
\
\'93The window of this library was immediately next to the one outside\
which the ladder was found, and both the secretary and His Majesty\
himself think that they would have seen something or heard a noise if\
the rope-ladder had been slung while they were in the room. They both,\
however, returned to the drawing-room at ten minutes past eleven.\
\
\'93And here,\'94 continued the man in the corner, rubbing his long, bony\
fingers together, \'93arose the neatest little complication I have ever\
come across in a case of this kind. His Majesty had, it appears,\
privately made up his mind to accept Mr. Wilson\'92s bid, but the\
transaction had not yet been completed. Mr. Wilson and his wife came\
down to stay at Eton Chase on 29th June, and directly they arrived\
many of those present noticed that Mr. Wilson was obviously repenting\
of his bargain. This impression had deepened day by day, Mrs. Wilson\
herself often throwing out covert hints about \'91fictitious value\'92 and\
\'91fancy prices for merely notorious trinkets.\'92 In fact, it became\
obvious that the Wilsons were really seeking a loophole for evading\
the conclusion of the bargain.\
\
\'93On the memorable evening of the 5th July, Mrs. Wilson had been forced\
to retire to her room early in the evening, owing, she said, to a bad\
headache; her room was in the west wing of the Chase, and opened out\
on the same corridor as the apartments of Her Majesty the Queen. At\
half-past eleven Mrs. Wilson rang for her maid\'97Mary Pritchard, who, on\
entering her mistress\'92s room, met Mr. Wilson just coming out of it,\
and the girl heard him say: \'91Oh, don\'92t worry! I\'92ll have the whole\
reset when we get back.\'92\
\
\'93The detectives, on the other hand, had obtained information that two\
or three days previously Mr. Wilson had sustained a very severe loss\
on the \'92Change, and that he had subsequently remarked to two or three\
business friends that the Black Diamonds had become a luxury which he\
had no right to afford.\
\
\'93Be this as it may, certain it is that within a week of the notorious\
burglary the rumour was current in every club in London that James S.\
Wilson, the reputed American millionaire, having found himself unable\
to complete the purchase of the Black Diamonds, had found this other\
very much less legitimate means of gaining possession of the gems.\
\
\'93You must admit that the case looked black enough against him\'97all\
circumstantial, of course, for there was absolutely nothing to prove\
that he had the jewels in his possession; in fact no trace of them\
whatever had been found, but the public argued that Mr. Wilson would\
lie low with them for a while, and then have them reset when he\
returned to America.\
\
\'93Of course, ugly rumours of that description don\'92t become general\
about a man without his getting some inkling of them. Mr. Wilson very\
soon found his position in London absolutely intolerable: his friends\
ignored him at the club, ladies ceased to call upon his wife, and one\
fine day he was openly cut by Lord Barnsdale, an M.F.H., in the\
hunting field.\
\
\'93Then Mr. Wilson thought it high time to take action. He placed the\
whole matter in the hands of an able if not very scrupulous solicitor\
who promised within a given time to find him a defendant with plenty\
of means, against whom he could bring a sensational libel suit, with\
thundering damages.\
\
\'93The solicitor was as good as his word. He bribed some of the waiters\
at the Carlton, and so laid his snares that within six months, Lord\
and Lady Barnsdale had been overheard to say in public what everybody\
now thought in private, namely, that Mr. James S. Wilson, finding\
himself unable to purchase the celebrated Black Diamonds, had thought\
it more profitable to steal them.\
\
\'93Two days later Mr. James S. Wilson entered an action in the High\
Courts for slander against Lord and Lady Barnsdale, claiming damages\
to the tune of \'a350,000.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93Still the mystery of the lost jewels was no nearer to its solution.\
Their Majesties the King and Queen of \'91Bohemia,\'92 had left England soon\
after the disastrous event which deprived them of what amounted to a\
small fortune.\
\
\'93It was expected that the sensational slander case would come on in\
the autumn, or rather more than sixteen months after the mysterious\
disappearance of the Black Diamonds.\
\
\'93This last season was not a very brilliant one, if you remember; the\
wet weather, I believe, had quite a good deal to do with the fact;\
nevertheless London, that great world centre, was, as usual, full of\
distinguished visitors, among whom Mrs. Vanderdellen, who arrived the\
second week in July, was perhaps the most interesting.\
\
\'93Her enormous wealth spread a positive halo round her, it being\
generally asserted that she was the richest woman in the world. Add to\
this that she was young, strikingly handsome, and a widow, and you\
will easily understand what a _furore_ her appearance during this\
London season caused in all high social circles.\
\
\'93Though she was still in slight mourning for her husband, she was\
asked everywhere, went everywhere, and was courted and admired by\
everybody, including some of the highest in the land; her dresses and\
jewellery were the talk of the ladies\'92 papers, her style and charm the\
gossip of all the clubs. And no doubt that, although the July evening\
Court promised to be very brilliant, every one thought that it would\
be doubly so, since Mrs. Vanderdellen had been honoured with an\
invitation, and would presumably be present.\
\
\'93I like to picture to myself that scene at Buckingham Palace,\'94\
continued the man in the corner, as his fingers toyed lovingly with a\
beautiful and brand-new bit of string. \'93Of course, I was not present\
actually, but I can see it all before me; the lights, the crowds, the\
pretty women, the glistening diamonds; then, in the midst of the\
chatter, a sudden silence fell as \'91Mrs. Vanderdellen\'92 was announced.\
\
\'93All women turned to look at the beautiful American as she entered,\
because her dress\'97on this her first appearance at the English\
Court\'97was sure to be a vision of style and beauty. But for once nobody\
noticed the dress from Felix, nobody even gave a glance at the\
exquisitely lovely face of the wearer. Every one\'92s eyes had fastened\
on one thing only, and every one\'92s lips framed but one exclamation,\
and that an \'91Oh!\'92 half of amazement and half of awe.\
\
\'93For round her neck and upon her head Mrs. Vanderdellen was wearing a\
gorgeously magnificent _parure_ composed of black diamonds.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93I don\'92t know how the case of Wilson _v._ Barnsdale was settled, for\
it never came into court. There were many people in London who owed\
the Wilsons an apology, and it is to be hoped that these were tendered\
in full.\
\
\'93As for Mrs. Vanderdellen, she seemed quite unaware why her appearance\
at Their Majesties\'92 Court had caused quite so much sensation. No one,\
of course, broached the subject of the diamonds to her, and she no\
doubt attributed those significant \'91Oh\'92s\'92 to her own dazzling beauty.\
\
\'93The next day, however, Detective Marsh, of Scotland Yard, had a very\
difficult task before him. He had to go and ask a beautiful, rich, and\
refined woman how she happened to be in possession of stolen\
jewellery.\
\
\'93Luckily for Marsh, however, he had to deal with a woman who was also\
charming, and who met his polite enquiry with an equally pleasant\
reply:\
\
\'93\'91My husband gave me the Black Diamonds,\'92 she said, \'91a year ago on his\
return from Europe. I had them set in Vienna last Spring, and wore\
them for the first time last night. Will you please tell me the reason\
of this strange enquiry?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Your husband?\'92 echoed Marsh, ignoring her question, \'91Mr.\
Vanderdellen?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh, yes,\'92 she replied sweetly, \'91I dare say you have never heard of\
him. His name is very well known in America, where they call him the\
\'93Petrol King.\'94 One of his hobbies was the collection of gems, which he\
was very fond of seeing me wear, and he gave me some magnificent\
jewels. The Black Diamonds certainly are very handsome. May I now\
request you to tell me,\'92 she repeated, with a certain assumption of\
hauteur, \'91the reason of all these enquiries?\'92\
\
\'93\'91The reason is simple enough, madam,\'92 replied the detective abruptly,\
\'91those diamonds were the property of Her Majesty the Queen of\
\'93Bohemia,\'94 and were stolen from Their Majesties\'92 residence, Eton\
Chase, Chislehurst, on the 5th of July last year.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Stolen!\'92 she repeated, aghast and obviously incredulous.\
\
\'93\'91Yes, stolen,\'92 said old Marsh. \'91I don\'92t wish to distress you\
unnecessarily, Madam, but you will see how imperative it is that you\
should place me in immediate communication with Mr. Vanderdellen, as\
an explanation from him has become necessary.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Unfortunately, that is impossible,\'92 said Mrs. Vanderdellen, who\
seemed under the spell of a strong emotion.\
\
\'93\'91Impossible?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Mr. Vanderdellen has been dead just over a year. He died three days\
after his return to New York, and the Black Diamonds were the last\
present he ever made me.\'92\
\
\'93There was a pause after that. Marsh\'97experienced detective though he\
was\'97was literally at his wits\'92 ends what to do. He said afterwards\
that Mrs. Vanderdellen, though very young and frivolous outwardly,\
seemed at the same time an exceedingly shrewd, farseeing business\
woman. To begin with, she absolutely refused to have the matter hushed\
up, and to return the jewels until their rightful ownership had been\
properly proved.\
\
\'93\'91It would be tantamount,\'92 she said, \'91to admitting that my husband had\
come by them unlawfully.\'92\
\
\'93At the same time she offered the princely reward of \'a310,000 to any\
one who found the true solution of the mystery; for, mind you, the\
late Mr. Vanderdellen sailed from Havre for New York on July the 8th,\
1902, that is to say, three clear days after the theft of the diamonds\
from Eton Chase, and he presented his wife with the loose gems\
immediately on his arrival in New York. Three days after that he died.\
\
\'93It was difficult to suppose that Mr. Vanderdellen purchased those\
diamonds not knowing that they must have been stolen, since, directly\
after the burglary the English police telegraphed to all their\
Continental colleagues, and within four-and-twenty hours a description\
of the stolen jewels was circulated throughout Europe.\
\
\'93It was, to say the least of it, very strange that an experienced\
business man and shrewd collector like Mr. Vanderdellen should have\
purchased such priceless gems without making some enquiries as to\
their history, more especially as they must have been offered to him\
in a more or less \'91hole-in-the-corner\'92 way.\
\
\'93Still, Mrs. Vanderdellen stuck to her guns, and refused to give up\
the jewels pending certain enquiries she wished to make. She declared\
that she wished to be sued for the diamonds in open court, charged\
with wilfully detaining stolen goods if necessary, for the more\
publicity was given to the whole affair the better she would like it,\
so firmly did she believe in her husband\'92s innocence.\
\
\'93The matter was indeed brought to the High Courts, and the sensational\
action brought against Mrs. Vanderdellen by the representative of His\
Majesty the King of \'91Bohemia\'92 for the recovery of the Black Diamonds\
is, no doubt, still fresh in your memory.\
\
\'93No one was allowed to know what witnesses Mrs. Vanderdellen would\
bring forward in her defence. She had engaged the services of Sir\
Arthur Inglewood, and of some of the most eminent counsel at the Bar.\
The court was packed with the most fashionable crowd ever seen inside\
the Law Courts; and both days that the action lasted Mrs. Vanderdellen\
appeared in exquisite gowns and ideal hats.\
\
\'93The evidence for the Royal plaintiff was simple enough. It all went\
to prove that the very day after the burglary not a jeweller,\
pawnbroker, or diamond merchant throughout the whole of Europe could\
have failed to know that a unique _parure_ of black diamonds had been\
stolen, and would probably be offered for sale. The Black Diamonds in\
themselves, and out of their setting, were absolutely unique, and if\
the late Mr. Vanderdellen purchased them in Paris from some private\
individual, he must at least have very strongly suspected that they\
were stolen.\
\
\'93Throughout the whole of that first day Mrs. Vanderdellen sat in\
court, absolutely calm and placid. She listened to the evidence, made\
little notes, and chatted with two or three American friends\'97elderly\
men\'97who were with her.\
\
\'93Then came the turn of the defence.\
\
\'93Everybody had expected something sensational, and listened more\
eagerly than ever as the name of Mr. Albert V. B. Sedley was called.\
He was a tall, elderly man, the regular angular type of the American,\
with his nasal twang and reposeful manner.\
\
\'93His story was brief and simple. He was a great friend of the late Mr.\
Vanderdellen, and had gone on a European tour with him in the early\
spring of 1902. They were together in Vienna in the month of March,\
staying at the Hotel Imperial, when one day Vanderdellen came to his\
room with a remarkable story.\
\
\'93\'91He told me,\'92 continued Mr. Albert V. B. Sedley, \'91that he had just\
purchased some very beautiful diamonds, which he meant to present to\
his wife on his return to New York. He would not tell me where he\
bought them, nor would he show them to me, but he spoke about the\
beauty and rarity of the stones, which were that rarest of all things,\
beautiful black diamonds.\
\
\'93\'91As the whole story sounded to me a little bit queer and mysterious,\
I gave him a word of caution, but he was quite confident as to the\
integrity of the vendor of the jewels, since the latter had made a\
somewhat curious bargain. Vanderdellen was to have the diamonds in his\
keeping for three months without paying any money, merely giving a\
formal receipt for them; then, if after three months he was quite\
satisfied with his bargain, and there had been no suspicion or rumour\
of any kind that the diamonds were stolen, then only was the money,\
\'a3500,000, to be paid.\
\
\'93\'91Vanderdellen thought this very fair and above-board, and so it\
sounded to me. The only thing I didn\'92t like about it all was that the\
vendor had given what I thought was a false name and no address; the\
money was to be paid over to him in French notes when the three months\
had expired, at an hotel in Paris, where Vanderdellen would be staying\
at the time, and where he would call for it.\
\
\'93\'91I heard nothing more about the mysterious diamonds and their still\
more mysterious vendor,\'92 continued Mr. Sedley, amidst intense\
excitement, \'91for Vanderdellen and I soon parted company after that, he\
going one way and I another. But at the beginning of July I met him in\
Paris, and on the 4th I dined with him at the Elysee Palace Hotel,\
where he was staying.\
\
\'93\'91Mr. Cornelius R. Shee was there too, and Vanderdellen related to him\
during dinner the history of his mysterious purchase of the Black\
Diamonds, adding that the vendor had called upon him that very day as\
arranged, and that he (Vanderdellen) had had no hesitation in handing\
him over the agreed price of \'a3500,000, which he thought a very low\
one. Both Mr. Shee and I agreed that the whole thing must have been\
clear and above-board, for jewels of such fabulous value could not\
have been stolen since last spring without the hue and cry being in\
every paper in Europe.\
\
\'93\'91It is my opinion, therefore,\'92 said Mr. Albert V. B. Sedley, at the\
conclusion of this remarkable evidence, \'91that Mr. Vanderdellen bought\
those diamonds in perfect good faith. He would never have wittingly\
subjected his wife to the indignity of being seen in public with\
stolen jewels round her neck. If after 5th July he did happen to hear\
that a _parure_ of black diamonds had been stolen in England at the\
date, he could not possibly think that there could be the slightest\
connection between these and those he had purchased more than three\
months ago.\'92\
\
\'93And, amidst indescribable excitement, Mr. Albert V. B. Sedley stepped\
back into his place.\
\
\'93That he had spoken the truth from beginning to end no one could doubt\
for a single moment. His own social position, wealth, and important\
commercial reputation placed him above any suspicion of committing\
perjury, even for the sake of a dead friend. Moreover, the story told\
by Vanderdellen at the dinner in Paris was corroborated by Mr.\
Cornelius R. Shee in every point.\
\
\'93But there! a dead man\'92s words are _not_ evidence in a court of law.\
Unfortunately, Mr. Vanderdellen had not shown the diamonds to his\
friends at the time. He had certainly drawn enormous sums of money\
from his bank about the end of June and beginning of July, amounting\
in all to just over a million sterling; and there was nothing to prove\
which special day he had paid away a sum of \'a3500,000, whether _before_\
or _after_ the burglary at Eton Chase.\
\
\'93He had made extensive purchases in Paris of pictures, furniture, and\
other works of art, all of priceless value, for the decoration of his\
new palace in Fifth Avenue, and no diary of private expenditure was\
produced in court. Mrs. Vanderdellen herself had said that after her\
husband\'92s death, as all his affairs were in perfect order, she had\
destroyed his personal and private diaries.\
\
\'93Thus the counsel for the plaintiff was able to demolish the whole\
edifice of the defence bit by bit, for it rested on but very ephemeral\
foundations: a story related by a dead man.\
\
\'93Judgment was entered for the plaintiff, although every one\'92s\
sympathy, including that of judge and of jury, was entirely for the\
defendant, who had so nobly determined to vindicate her husband\'92s\
reputation.\
\
\'93But Mrs. Vanderdellen proved to the last that she was no ordinary and\
everyday woman. She had kept one final sensation up her sleeve. Two\
days after she had legally been made to give up the Black Diamonds,\
she offered to purchase them back for \'a3500,000. Her bid was accepted,\
and during last autumn, on the occasion of the last Royal visit to\
London and the consequent grand society functions, no one was more\
admired, more _f\'eated_ and envied, than beautiful Mrs. Vanderdellen as\
she entered a drawing-room exquisitely gowned, and adorned with the\
_parure_ of which an Empress might have been proud.\'94\
\
The man in the corner had paused, and was idly tapping his fingers on\
the marble-topped table of the A.B.C. shop.\
\
\'93It was a curious story, wasn\'92t it?\'94 said the funny creature, after a\
while. \'93More like a romance than a reality.\'94\
\
\'93It is absolutely bewildering,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93What is your theory?\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93What about?\'94 I retorted.\
\
\'93Well, there are so many points, aren\'92t there, of which only one is\
quite clear, namely, that the _parure_ of Black Diamonds disappeared\
from Eton Chase, Chislehurst, on 5th July, 1902, and that the next\
time they were seen they were on the neck and head of Mrs.\
Vanderdellen, the widow of one of the richest men of modern times,\
whilst the story of how her husband came by them was, to all intents\
and purposes, _legally_ disbelieved.\'94\
\
\'93Then,\'94 I argued, \'93the only logical conclusions to arrive at in all\
this is that the Black Diamonds, owned by His Majesty the King of\
\'91Bohemia,\'92 were not unique, and that Mr. Vanderdellen bought some\
duplicate ones.\'94\
\
\'93If you knew anything about diamonds,\'94 he said irritably, \'93you would\
also know that your statement is an absurdity. There are no such\
things as \'91duplicate\'92 diamonds.\'94\
\
\'93Then what _is_ the only logical conclusion to arrive at?\'94 I retorted,\
for he had given up playing with the photos and was twisting and\
twining that bit of string as if his brain was contained inside it and\
he feared it might escape.\
\
\'93Well, to me,\'94 he said, \'93the only logical conclusion of the affair is\
that the Black Diamonds which Mrs. Vanderdellen wore were the only and\
original ones belonging to the Crown of \'91Bohemia.\'92\'94\
\
\'93Then you think that a man in Mr. Vanderdellen\'92s position would have\
been fool enough to buy gems worth \'a3500,000 at the very moment when\
there was a hue and cry for them all over Europe?\'94\
\
\'93No, I don\'92t,\'94 he replied quietly.\
\
\'93But then\'97\'97\'94 I began.\
\
\'93No?\'94 he repeated once again, as his long fingers completed knot\
number one in that eternal piece of string. \'93The Black Diamonds which\
Mrs. Vanderdellen wore were bought by her husband in all good faith\
from the mysterious vendor in Vienna, in March, 1902.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94 I retorted. \'93Her Majesty the Queen of \'91Bohemia\'92 wore\
them regularly during the months of May and June, and they were stolen\
from Eton Chase on July the 5th.\'94\
\
\'93Her Majesty the Queen of \'91Bohemia\'92 wore a _parure_ of Black Diamonds\
during those months, and those certainly were stolen on July the 5th,\'94\
he said excitedly; \'93but what was there to prove that _those_ were the\
genuine stones?\'94\
\
\'93Why!\'97\'97\'94 I ejaculated.\
\
\'93Point No. 2,\'94 he said, jumping about like a monkey on a stick;\
\'93although Mr. Wilson was acknowledged to be innocent of the theft of\
the diamonds, isn\'92t it strange that no one has ever been proved guilty\
of it?\'94\
\
\'93But I don\'92t understand\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Yet it is simple as daylight. I maintain that His Majesty the King\
of \'91Bohemia\'92 being short, very short, of money, decided to sell\
the celebrated Black Diamonds; to avoid all risks the stones are\
taken out of their settings, and a trusted and secret emissary is\
then deputed to find a possible purchaser; his choice falls on the\
multi-millionaire Vanderdellen, who is travelling in Europe, is\
a noted collector of rare jewellery, and has a beautiful young\
wife\'97three attributes, you see, which make him a very likely\
purchaser.\
\
\'93The emissary then seeks him out, and offers him the diamonds for\
sale. Mr. Vanderdellen at first hesitates, wondering how such valuable\
gems had come in the vendor\'92s possession, but the bargain suggested by\
the latter\'97the three months during which the gems are to be held on\
trust by the purchaser\'97seems so fair and above-board, that Mr.\
Vanderdellen\'92s objections fall to the ground; he accepts the bargain,\
and three months later completes the purchase.\'94\
\
\'93But I don\'92t understand,\'94 I repeated again, more bewildered than\
before. \'93You say the King of \'91Bohemia\'92 sold the loose gems originally\
to Mr. Vanderdellen; then, what about the _parure_ worn by the Queen\
and offered for sale to Mr. and Mrs. Wilson? What about the theft at\
Eton Chase?\'94\
\
\'93Point No. 3,\'94 he shrieked excitedly, as another series of complicated\
knots went to join its fellows. \'93I told you that the King of \'91Bohemia\'92\
was _very_ short of money, every one knows _that_. He sells the Black\
Diamonds to Mr. Vanderdellen, but before he does it, he causes\
duplicates of them to be made, but this time in exquisite, beautiful,\
perfect Parisian imitation, and has these mounted into the original\
settings by some trusted man who, you may be sure, was well paid to\
hold his tongue. Then it is given out that the _parure_ is for sale; a\
purchaser is found, and a few days later the false diamonds are\
stolen.\'94\
\
\'93By whom?\'94\
\
\'93By the King of \'91Bohemia\'92s\'92 valued and trusted friend, who has helped\
in the little piece of villainy throughout; it is he who drops a\
rope-ladder through Her Majesty\'92s bedroom window on to the terrace\
below, and then hands the imitation _parure_ to his Royal master, who\
sees to its complete destruction and disappearance. Then there is a\
hue and cry for the _real_ stones, and after a year or so they are\
found on the person of a lady, who is legally forced to give them up.\
And thus His Majesty the King of \'91Bohemia\'92 got one solid million for\
the Black Diamonds, instead of half that sum, for if Mrs. Vanderdellen\
had not purchased the jewels, some one else would have done so.\'94\
\
And he was gone, leaving me to gaze at the pictures of three lovely\
women, and wondering if indeed it was the Royal lady herself who could\
best solve the mystery of who stole the Black Diamonds.\
\
\
\
V. The Murder of Miss Pebmarsh\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93You must admit,\'94 said the man in the corner to me one day, as I\
folded up and put aside my _Daily Telegraph_, which I had been reading\
with great care, \'93that it would be difficult to find a more\
interesting plot, or more thrilling situations, than occurred during\
the case of Miss Pamela Pebmarsh. As for downright cold-blooded\
villainy, commend me to some of the actors in that real drama.\
\
\'93The facts were simple enough; Miss Lucy Ann Pebmarsh was an old maid\
who lived with her young niece Pamela and an elderly servant in one of\
the small, newly-built houses not far from the railway station at\
Boreham Wood. The fact that she kept a servant at all, and that the\
little house always looked very spick and span, was taken by the\
neighbours to mean that Miss Pebmarsh was a lady of means; but she\
kept very much to herself, seldom went to church, and never attended\
any of the mothers\'92 meetings, parochial teas, and other social\
gatherings for which that popular neighbourhood has long been famous.\
\
\'93Very little, therefore, was known of the Pebmarsh household, save\
that the old lady had seen better days, that she had taken her niece\
to live with her recently, and that the latter had had a somewhat\
checkered career before she had found her present haven of refuge;\
some more venturesome gossips went so far as to hint\'97but only just\
above a whisper\'97that Miss Pamela Pebmarsh had been on the stage.\
\
\'93Certain it is that that young lady seemed to chafe very much under\
the restraint imposed upon her by her aunt, who seldom allowed her out\
of her sight, and evidently kept her very short of money, for, in\
spite of Miss Pamela\'92s obvious love of fine clothes, she had latterly\
been constrained to wear the plainest of frocks and most unbecoming of\
hats.\
\
\'93All very commonplace and uninteresting, you see, until that memorable\
Wednesday in October, after which the little house in Boreham Wood\
became a nine days\'92 wonder throughout newspaper-reading England.\
\
\'93On that day Miss Pebmarsh\'92s servant, Jemima Gadd, went over to Luton\
to see a sick sister; she was not expected back until the next\
morning. On that same afternoon Miss Pamela\'97strangely enough\'97seems\
also to have elected to go up to town, leaving her aunt all alone in\
the house, and not returning home until the late train, which reaches\
Boreham Wood a few minutes before one.\
\
\'93It was about five minutes past one that the neighbours in the quiet\
little street were roused from their slumbers by most frantic and\
agonised shrieks. The next moment Miss Pamela was seen to rush out of\
her aunt\'92s house and then to hammer violently at the door of one of\
her neighbours, still uttering piercing shrieks. You may imagine what\
a commotion such a scene at midnight would cause in a place like\
Boreham Wood. Heads were thrust out of the windows; one or two\
neighbours in hastily-donned miscellaneous attire came running out;\
and very soon the news spread round like wild-fire that Miss Pamela on\
coming home had found her aunt lying dead in the sitting-room.\
\
\'93Mr. Miller, the local greengrocer, was the first to pluck up\
sufficient courage to effect an entrance into the house. Miss Pamela\
dared not follow him; she had become quite hysterical, and was\
shrieking at the top of her voice that her aunt had been murdered. The\
sight that greeted Mr. Miller and those who had been venturesome\
enough to follow him, was certainly calculated to unhinge any young\
girl\'92s mind.\
\
\'93In the small bow-window of the sitting-room stood a writing-table,\
with drawers open and papers scattered all over and around it; in a\
chair in front of it, half sitting and half lying across the table,\
face downwards, and with arms outstretched, was the dead body of Miss\
Pebmarsh. There was sufficient indications to show to the most casual\
observer that, undoubtedly, the unfortunate lady had been murdered.\
\
\'93One of the neighbours, who possessed a bicycle, had in the meantime\
had the good sense to ride over to the police station. Very soon two\
constables were on the spot; they quickly cleared the room of\
gossiping neighbours, and then endeavoured to obtain from Miss Pamela\
some lucid information as to the terrible event.\
\
\'93At first she seemed quite unable to answer coherently the many\
questions which were being put to her; however, with infinite patience\
and wonderful kindness, Sergeant Evans at last managed to obtain from\
her the following statement.\
\
\'93\'91I had had an invitation to go to the theatre this evening; it was an\
old invitation, and my aunt had said long ago that I might accept it.\
When Jemima Gadd wanted to go to Luton, I didn\'92t see why I should give\
up the theatre and offend my friend, just because of her. My aunt and\
I had some words about it, but I went. . . . I came back by the last\
train, and walked straight home from the station. I had taken the\
latch-key with me, and went straight into the sitting-room; the lamp\
was alight, and\'97and\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93The rest was chaos in the poor girl\'92s mind; she was only conscious of\
having seen something awful and terrible, and of having rushed out\
screaming for help. Sergeant Evans asked her no further questions\
then; a kind neighbour had offered to take charge of Pamela for the\
night, and took her away with her, the constable remaining in charge\
of the body and the house until the arrival of higher authorities.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93Although, as you may well suppose,\'94 continued the man in the corner,\
after a pause, \'93the excitement was intense at Boreham Wood, it had not\
as yet reached the general newspaper-reading public. As the tragic\
event had occurred at one o\'92clock in the morning, the papers the\
following day only contained a brief announcement that an old lady had\
been found murdered at Boreham Wood under somewhat mysterious\
circumstances. Later on, the evening editions added that the police\
were extremely reticent, but that it was generally understood that\
they held an important clue.\
\
\'93The following day had been fixed for the inquest, and I went down\
myself in the morning, for somehow I felt that this case was going to\
be an interesting one. A murder which at first seems absolutely\
purposeless always, in my experience, reveals, sooner or later, an\
interesting trait in human nature.\
\
\'93As soon as I arrived at Boreham Wood, I found that the murder of Miss\
Pebmarsh and the forthcoming inquest seemed to be the sole subjects of\
gossip and conversation. After I had been in the place half an hour\
the news began to spread like wild-fire that the murderer had been\
arrested; five minutes later the name of the murderer was on\
everybody\'92s lips.\
\
\'93It was that of the murdered woman\'92s niece, Miss Pamela Pebmarsh.\
\
\'93\'91Oh, oh!\'92 I said to myself, \'91my instincts have not deceived me: this\
case is indeed going to be interesting.\'92\
\
\'93It was about two o\'92clock in the afternoon when I at last managed to\
find my way to the little police station, where the inquest was to be\
held. There was scarcely standing room, I can tell you, and I had some\
difficulty in getting a front place from which I could see the\
principal actors in this village drama.\
\
\'93Pamela Pebmarsh was there in the custody of two constables\'97she, a\
young girl scarcely five-and-twenty, stood there accused of having\
murdered, in a peculiarly brutal way, an old lady of seventy, her\
relative who had befriended her and given her a home.\'94\
\
The man in the corner paused for a moment, and from the capacious\
pocket of his magnificent ulster he drew two or three small photos,\
which he placed before me.\
\
\'93This is Miss Pamela Pebmarsh,\'94 he said, pointing to one of these;\
\'93tall and good-looking, in spite of the shabby bit of mourning with\
which she had contrived to deck herself. Of course, this photo does\
not give you an idea of what she looked like that day at the inquest.\
Her face then was almost ashen in colour; her large eyes were staring\
before her with a look of horror and of fear; and her hands were\
twitching incessantly, with spasmodic and painful nervousness.\
\
\'93It was pretty clear that public feeling went dead against her from\
the very first. A murmur of disapproval greeted her appearance, to\
which she seemed to reply with a look of defiance. I could hear many\
uncharitable remarks spoken all round me; Boreham Wood found it\
evidently hard to forgive Miss Pamela her good looks and her unavowed\
past.\
\
\'93The medical evidence was brief and simple. Miss Pebmarsh had been\
stabbed in the back with some sharp instrument, the blade of which had\
pierced the left lung. She had evidently been sitting in the chair in\
front of her writing-table when the murderer had caught her unawares.\
Death had ensued within the next few seconds.\
\
\'93The medical officer was very closely questioned upon this point by\
the coroner; it was evident that the latter had something very serious\
in his mind, to which the doctor\'92s replies would give confirmation.\
\
\'93\'91In your opinion,\'92 he asked, \'91would it have been possible for Miss\
Pebmarsh to do anything after she was stabbed. Could she have moved,\
for instance?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Slightly, perhaps,\'92 replied the doctor; \'91but she did not attempt to\
rise from her chair.\'92\
\
\'93\'91No; but could she have tried to reach the hand-bell, for instance,\
which was on the table, or\'97the pen and ink\'97and written a word or two?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Well, yes,\'92 said the doctor thoughtfully; \'91she might have done that,\
if pen and ink, or the hand-bell, were _very_ close to her hand. I\
doubt, though, if she could have written anything very clearly, but\
still it is impossible to say quite definitely\'97anyhow, it could only\
have been a matter of a few seconds.\'92\
\
\'93Delightfully vague, you see,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93as\
these learned gentlemen\'92s evidence usually is.\
\
\'93Sergeant Evans then repeated the story which Pamela Pebmarsh had\
originally told him, and from which she had never departed in any\
detail. She had gone to the theatre, leaving her aunt all alone in the\
house; she had arrived home at one o\'92clock by the late Wednesday night\
train, and had gone straight into the sitting-room, where she had\
found her aunt dead before her writing-table.\
\
\'93That she travelled up to London in the afternoon was easily proved;\
the station-master and the porters had seen her go. Unfortunately for\
her _alibi_, however, those late \'91theatre\'92 trains on that line are\
always very crowded; the night had been dark and foggy, and no one at\
or near the station could swear positively to having seen her arrive\
home again by the train she named.\
\
\'93There was one thing more; although the importance of it had been\
firmly impressed upon Pamela Pebmarsh, she absolutely refused to name\
the friends with whom she had been to the theatre that night, and who,\
presumably, might have helped her to prove at what hour she left\
London for home.\
\
\'93Whilst all this was going on, I was watching Pamela\'92s face intently.\
That the girl was frightened\'97nay more, terrified\'97there could be no\
doubt; the twitching of her hands, her eyes dilated with terror, spoke\
of some awful secret which she dare not reveal, but which she felt was\
being gradually brought to light. Was that secret the secret of a\
crime\'97a crime so horrible, so gruesome, that surely so young a girl\
would be incapable of committing?\
\
\'93So far, however, what struck every one mostly during this inquest was\
the seeming purposelessness of this cruel murder. The old lady, as far\
as could be ascertained, had no money to leave, so why should Pamela\
Pebmarsh have deliberately murdered the aunt who provided her, at any\
rate, with the comforts of a home? But the police, assisted by one of\
the most able detectives on the staff, had not effected so sensational\
an arrest without due cause; they had a formidable array of witnesses\
to prove their case up to the hilt. One of these was Jemima Gadd, the\
late Miss Pebmarsh\'92s servant.\
\
\'93She came forward attired in deep black, and wearing a monumental\
crape bonnet crowned with a quantity of glistening black beads. With\
her face the colour of yellow wax, and her thin lips pinched tightly\
together, she stood as the very personification of puritanism and\
uncharitableness.\
\
\'93She did not look once towards Pamela, who gazed at her like some\
wretched bird caught in a net, which sees the meshes tightening round\
it more and more.\
\
\'93Replying to the coroner, Jemima Gadd explained that on the Wednesday\
morning she had had a letter from her sister at Luton, asking her to\
come over and see her some day.\
\
\'93\'91As there was plenty of cold meat in the \'92ouse,\'92 she said, \'91I asked\
the mistress if she could spare me until the next day, and she said\
yes, she could. Miss Pamela and she could manage quite well.\'92\
\
\'93\'91She said nothing about her niece going out, too, on the same day?\'92\
asked the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91No,\'92 replied Jemima acidly, \'91she did not. And later on, at\
breakfast, Miss Pebmarsh said to Miss Pamela before me: \'93Pamela,\'94 she\
says, \'93Jemima is going to Luton, and won\'92t be back until to-morrow.\
You and I will be alone in the \'92ouse until then.\'94\'92\
\
\'93\'91And what did the accused say?\'92\
\
\'93\'91She says, \'93All right, aunt.\'94\'92\
\
\'93\'91Nothing more?\'92\
\
\'93\'91No, nothing more.\'92\
\
\'93\'91There was no question, then, of the accused going out also, and\
leaving Miss Pebmarsh all alone in the house?\'92\
\
\'93\'91None at all,\'92 said Jemima emphatically. \'91If there \'92ad been I\'92d \'92ave\
\'92eard of it. I needn\'92t \'92ave gone that day. Any day would \'92ave done for\
me.\'92\
\
\'93She closed her thin lips with a snap, and darted a vicious look at\
Pamela. There was obviously some old animosity lurking beneath that\
gigantic crape monument on the top of Jemima\'92s wax-coloured head.\
\
\'93\'91You know nothing, then, about any disagreement between the deceased\
and the accused on the subject of her going to the theatre that day?\'92\
asked the coroner, after a while.\
\
\'93\'91No, not about _that_,\'92 said Jemima curtly, \'91but there was plenty of\
disagreements between those two, I can tell you.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Ah! what about?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Money, mostly. Miss Pamela was over-fond of fine clothes, but Miss\
Pebmarsh, who was giving \'92er a \'92ome and daily bread, \'92adn\'92t much money\
to spare for fallalery. Miss Pebmarsh \'92ad a small pension from a lady\
of the haristocracy, but it wasn\'92t much\'97a pound a week it was. Miss\
Pebmarsh might \'92ave \'92ad a lot more if she\'92d wanted to.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh?\'92 queried the coroner, \'91how was that?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Well, you see, that fine lady \'92ad not always been as good as she\
ought to be. She\'92d been Miss Pamela\'92s friend when they were both on\
the stage together, and pretty goings on, I can tell you, those two\
were up to, and\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93\'91That\'92ll do,\'92 interrupted the coroner sternly. \'91Confine yourself,\
please, to telling the jury about the pension Miss Pebmarsh had from a\
lady.\'92\
\
\'93\'91I was speaking about that,\'92 said Jemima, with another snap of her\
thin lips. \'91Miss Pebmarsh knew a thing or two about this fine lady,\
and she had some letters which she often told me that fine lady would\
not care for her \'92usband or her fine friends to read. Miss Pamela got\
to know about these letters, and she worried her poor aunt to death,\
for she wanted to get those letters and sell them to the fine lady for\
\'92undreds of pounds. I \'92ave \'92eard \'92er ask for those letters times and\
again, but Miss Pebmarsh wouldn\'92t give them to \'92er, and they were\
locked up in the writing-table drawer, and Miss Pamela wanted those\
letters, for she wanted to get \'92undreds of pounds from the fine lady,\
and my poor mistress was murdered for those letters\'97and she was\
murdered by that wicked girl \'92oo eat her bread and \'92oo would \'92ave\
starved but for \'92er. And so I tell you, and I don\'92t care \'92oo \'92ears me\
say it.\'92\
\
\'93No one had attempted to interrupt Jemima Gadd as she delivered\
herself of this extraordinary tale, which so suddenly threw an\
unexpected and lurid light upon the mystery of poor Miss Pebmarsh\'92s\
death.\
\
\'93That the tale was a true one, no one doubted for a single instant.\
One look at the face of the accused was sufficient to prove it beyond\
question. Pamela Pebmarsh had become absolutely livid; she tottered\
almost as if she would fall, and the constable had to support her\
until a chair was brought forward for her.\
\
\'93As for Jemima Gadd, she remained absolutely impassive. Having given\
her evidence, she stepped aside automatically like a yellow waxen\
image, which had been wound up and had now run down. There was silence\
for a while. Pamela Pebmarsh, more dead than alive, was sipping a\
glass of brandy and water, which alone prevented her from falling in a\
dead faint.\
\
\'93Detective Inspector Robinson now stepped forward. All the spectators\
there could read on his face the consciousness that his evidence would\
be of the most supreme import.\
\
\'93\'91I was telegraphed for from the Yard,\'92 he said, in reply to the\
coroner, \'91and came down here by the first train on the Thursday\
morning. Beyond the short medical examination the body had not been\
touched; as the constables know, we don\'92t like things interfered with\
in cases of this kind. When I went up to look at deceased, the first\
thing I saw was a piece of paper just under her right hand. Sergeant\
Evans had seen it before, and pointed it out to me. Deceased had a pen\
in her hand, and the ink-bottle was close by. This is the paper I\
found, sir.\'92\
\
\'93And amidst a deadly silence, during which nothing could be heard but\
the scarcely-perceptible rustle of the paper, the inspector handed a\
small note across to the coroner. The latter glanced at it for a\
moment, and his face became very grave and solemn as he turned towards\
the jury.\
\
\'93\'91Gentlemen of the jury,\'92 he said, \'91these are the contents of the\
paper which the inspector found under the hand of the deceased.\'92\
\
\'93He paused once more before he began to read, whilst we all in that\
crowded court held our breath to listen:\
\
\'93\'91_I am dying. My murderess is my niece, Pam_\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93\'91That is all, gentlemen,\'92 added the coroner, as he folded up the\
note. \'91Death overtook the unfortunate woman in the very act of writing\
down the name of her murderess.\'92\
\
\'93Then there was a wild and agonised shriek of horror. Pamela Pebmarsh,\
with hair dishevelled and eyes in which the light of madness had begun\
to gleam, threw up her hands, and without a groan, fell down senseless\
upon the floor.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said the man in the corner with a chuckle, \'93there was enough\
evidence there to hang twenty people, let alone that one fool of a\
girl who had run her neck so madly into a noose. I don\'92t suppose that\
any one left the court that day with the slightest doubt in their\
minds as to what the verdict would be; for the coroner had adjourned\
the inquest, much to the annoyance of the jury, who had fully made up\
their minds and had their verdict pat on the tips of their tongues:\
\'91Wilful murder against Pamela Pebmarsh.\'92\
\
\'93But this was a case which to the last kept up its reputation for\
surprises. By the next morning rumour had got about that \'91the lady of\
the aristocracy\'92 referred to by Jemima Gadd, and who was supposed to\
have paid a regular pension to Miss Pebmarsh, was none other than Lady\
de Chavasse.\
\
\'93When the name was first mentioned every one\'97especially the fair\
sex\'97shrugged their shoulders, and said: \'91Of course what else _could_\
one expect?\'92\
\
\'93As a matter of fact, Lady de Chavasse, _n\'e9e_ Birdie Fay, was one of\
the most fashionable women in society; she was at the head of a dozen\
benevolent institutions, was a generous patron of hospitals, and her\
house was one of the most exclusive houses in London. True, she had\
been on the stage in her younger days, and when Sir Percival de\
Chavasse married her, his own relations looked somewhat askance at the\
showy, handsome girl who had so daringly entered the ancient country\
family.\
\
\'93Sir Percival himself was an extraordinarily proud man\'97proud of his\
lineage, of his social status, of the honour of his name. His very\
pride had forced his relations, had forced society to accept his\
beautiful young wife, and to Lady de Chavasse\'92s credit be it said, not\
one breath of scandal as to her past life had ever become public\
gossip. No one could assert that they _knew_ anything derogatory to\
Birdie Fay before she became the proud baronet\'92s wife. As a matter of\
fact, all society asserted that Sir Percival would never have married\
her and introduced her to his own family circle if there had been any\
gossip about her.\
\
\'93Now suddenly the name of Lady de Chavasse was on everybody\'92s tongue.\
People at first spoke it under their breath, for every one felt great\
sympathy with her. She was so rich, and entertained so lavishly. She\
was very charming, too; most fascinating in her ways; deferential to\
her austere mother-in-law; not a little afraid of her proud husband;\
very careful lest by word or look she betrayed her early connection\
with the stage before him.\
\
\'93On the following day, however, we had further surprises in store for\
us. Pamela Pebmarsh, advised by a shrewd and clear-headed solicitor,\
had at last made up her mind to view her danger a little more coolly,\
and to speak rather more of the truth than she had done hitherto.\
\
\'93Still looking very haggard, but perhaps a little less scared, she now\
made a statement which, when it was fully substantiated, as she stated\
it could be, would go far towards clearing her of the terrible\
imputation against her. Her story was this: On the memorable day in\
question, she did go up to town, intending to go to the theatre. At\
the station she purchased an evening paper, which she began to read.\
This paper in its fashionable columns contained an announcement which\
arrested her attention; this was that Sir Percival and Lady de\
Chavasse had returned to their flat in town at 51, Marsden Mansions,\
Belgravia, from \'91The Chase,\'92 Melton Mowbray.\
\
\'93\'91De Chavasse,\'92 continued Pamela, \'91was the name of the lady who paid\
my aunt the small pension on which she lived. I knew her years ago,\
when she was on the stage, and I suddenly thought I would like to go\
and see her, just to have a chat over old times. Instead of going to\
the theatre I went and had some dinner at Slater\'92s, in Piccadilly, and\
then I thought I would take my chance, and go and see if Lady de\
Chavasse was at home. I got to 51, Marsden Mansions, about eight\
o\'92clock, and was fortunate enough to see Lady de Chavasse at once. She\
kept me talking some considerable time; so much, in fact, that I\
missed the 11 from St. Pancras. I only left Marsden Mansions at a\
quarter to eleven, and had to wait at St. Pancras until twenty minutes\
past midnight.\'92\
\
\'93This was all reasonable and clear enough, and as her legal adviser\
had subp\'9cnaed Lady de Chavasse as a witness, Pamela Pebmarsh seemed to\
have found an excellent way out of her terrible difficulties, the only\
question being whether Lady de Chavasse\'92s testimony alone would, in\
view of her being Pamela\'92s friend, be sufficient to weigh against the\
terrible overwhelming evidence of Miss Pebmarsh\'92s dying accusation.\
\
\'93But Lady de Chavasse settled this doubtful point in the way least\
expected by any one. Exquisitely dressed, golden-haired, and brilliant\
complexioned, she looked strangely out of place in this fusty little\
village court, amidst the local dames in their plain gowns and\
antiquated bonnets. She was, moreover, extremely self-possessed, and\
only cast a short, very haughty, look at the unfortunate girl whose\
life probably hung upon that fashionable woman\'92s word.\
\
\'93\'91Yes,\'92 she said sweetly, in reply to the coroner, \'91she was the wife\
of Sir Percival de Chavasse, and resided at 51, Marsden Mansions,\
Belgravia.\'92\
\
\'93\'91The accused, I understand, has been known to you for some time?\'92\
continued the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91Pardon me,\'92 rejoined Lady de Chavasse, speaking in a beautiful\
modulated voice, \'91I did know this young\'97hem\'97person, years ago, when I\
was on the stage, but, of course, I had not seen her for years.\'92\
\
\'93\'91She called on you on Wednesday last at about nine o\'92clock?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Yes, she did, for the purpose of levying blackmail upon me.\'92\
\
\'93There was no mistaking the look of profound aversion and contempt\
which the fashionable lady now threw upon the poor girl before her.\
\
\'93\'91She had some preposterous story about some letters which she alleged\
would be compromising to my reputation,\'92 continued Lady de Chavasse\
quietly. \'91These she had the kindness to offer me for sale for a\
hundred pounds. At first her impudence staggered me, as, of course, I\
had no knowledge of any such letters. She threatened to take them to\
my husband, however, and I then\'97rather foolishly, perhaps\'97suggested\
that she should bring them to me first. I forget how the conversation\
went on, but she left me with the understanding that she would get the\
letters from her aunt, Miss Pebmarsh, who, by the way, had been my\
governess when I was a child, and to whom I paid a small pension in\
consideration of her having been left absolutely without means.\'92\
\
\'93And Lady de Chavasse, conscious of her own disinterested benevolence,\
pressed a highly-scented bit of cambric to her delicate nose.\
\
\'93\'91Then the accused did spend the evening with you on that Wednesday?\'92\
asked the coroner, while a great sigh of relief seemed to come from\
poor Pamela\'92s breast.\
\
\'93\'91Pardon me,\'92 said Lady de Chavasse, \'91she spent a little time with me.\
She came about nine o\'92clock.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Yes. And when did she leave?\'92\
\
\'93\'91I really couldn\'92t tell you\'97about ten o\'92clock, I think.\'92\
\
\'93\'91You are not sure?\'92 persisted the coroner. \'91Think, Lady de Chavasse,\'92\
he added earnestly, \'91try to think\'97the life of a fellow-creature may,\
perhaps, depend upon your memory.\'92\
\
\'93\'91I am indeed sorry,\'92 she replied in the same musical voice. \'91I could\
not swear without being positive, could I? And I am not quite\
positive.\'92\
\
\'93\'91But your servants?\'92\
\
\'93\'91They were at the back of the flat\'97the girl let herself out.\'92\
\
\'93\'91But your husband?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh! when he saw me engaged with the girl, he went out to his club,\
and was not yet home when she left.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Birdie! Birdie! won\'92t you try and remember?\'92 here came in an\
agonised cry from the unfortunate girl, who thus saw her last hope\
vanish before her eyes.\
\
\'93But Lady de Chavasse only lifted a little higher a pair of very\
prettily-arched eyebrows, and having finished her evidence she stepped\
on one side and presently left the court, leaving behind her a faint\
aroma of violet sachet powder, and taking away with her, perhaps, the\
last hope of an innocent fellow-creature.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93But Pamela Pebmarsh?\'94 I asked after a while, for he had paused and\
was gazing attentively at the photograph of a very beautiful and\
exquisitely-gowned woman.\
\
\'93Ah, yes, Pamela Pebmarsh,\'94 he said with a smile. \'93There was yet\
another act in that palpitating drama of her life\'97one act\'97the\
_d\'e9nouement_ as unexpected as it was thrilling. Salvation came where\
it was least expected\'97from Jemima Gadd, who seemed to have made up her\
mind that Pamela had killed her aunt, and yet who was the first to\
prove her innocence.\
\
\'93She had been shown the few words which the murdered woman was alleged\
to have written after she had been stabbed. Jemima, not a very good\
scholar, found it difficult to decipher the words herself.\
\
\'93\'91Ah, well, poor dear,\'92 she said after a while, with a deep sigh, \'91\'92er\
\'92andwriting was always peculiar, seein\'92 as \'92ow she wrote always with\
\'92er left \'92and.\'92\
\
\'93\'91_Her left hand!!!_\'92 gasped the coroner, while public and jury alike,\
hardly liking to credit their ears, hung upon the woman\'92s thin lips,\
amazed, aghast, puzzled.\
\
\'93\'91Why, yes!\'92 said Jemima placidly. \'91Didn\'92t you know she \'92ad a bad\
accident to \'92er right \'92and when she was a child, and never could \'92old\
anything in it? \'92Er fingers were like paralysed; the ink-pot was\
always on the left of \'92er writing-table. Oh! she couldn\'92t write with\
\'92er right \'92and at all.\'92\
\
\'93Then a strange revulsion of feeling came over every one there.\
\
\'93Stabbed in the back, with her lung pierced through and through, how\
could she have done, dying, what she never did in life?\
\
\'93Impossible!\
\
\'93The murderer, whoever it was, had placed pen and paper to her hand,\
and had written on it the cruel words which were intended to delude\
justice and to send an innocent fellow-creature\'97a young girl not\
five-and-twenty\'97to an unjust and ignominious death. But, fortunately\
for that innocent girl, the cowardly miscreant had ignored the fact\
that Miss Pebmarsh\'92s right hand had been paralysed for years.\
\
\'93The inquest was adjourned for a week,\'94 continued the man in the\
corner, \'93which enabled Pamela\'92s solicitor to obtain further evidence\
of her innocence. Fortunately for her he was enabled to find two\
witnesses who had seen her in an omnibus going towards St. Pancras at\
about 11.15 p.m., and a passenger on the 12.25 train, who had\
travelled down with her as far as Hendon. Thus, when the inquest was\
resumed, Pamela Pebmarsh left the court without a stain upon her\
character.\
\
\'93But the murder of Miss Pebmarsh has remained a mystery to this day\'97as\
has also the secret history of the compromising letters. Did they\
exist or not? is a question the interested spectators at that\
memorable inquest have often asked themselves. Certain it is that\
failing Pamela Pebmarsh, who might have wanted them for purpose of\
blackmail, no one else could be interested in them except Lady de\
Chavasse.\'94\
\
\'93Lady de Chavasse!\'94 I ejaculated in surprise. \'93Surely you are not\
going to pretend that that elegant lady went down to Boreham Wood in\
the middle of the night in order to murder Miss Pebmarsh, and then to\
lay the crime at another woman\'92s door?\'94\
\
\'93I only pretend what\'92s logic,\'94 replied the man in the corner, with\
inimitable conceit; \'93and in Pamela Pebmarsh\'92s own statement, she was\
with Lady de Chavasse at 51, Marsden Mansions, until eleven o\'92clock,\
and there is no train from St. Pancras to Boreham Wood between eleven\
and twenty-five minutes past midnight. Pamela\'92s _alibi_ becomes that\
of Lady de Chavasse, and is quite conclusive. Besides, that elegant\
lady was not one to do that sort of work for herself.\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Do you mean to say you never thought of the real solution of this\
mystery?\'94 he retorted sarcastically.\
\
\'93I confess\'97\'97\'94 I began a little irritably.\
\
\'93Confess that I have not yet taught you to think logically, and to\
look at the beginning of things.\'94\
\
\'93What do you call the beginning of this case, then?\'94\
\
\'93Why! the compromising letters, of course.\'94\
\
\'93But\'97\'97\'94 I argued.\
\
\'93Wait a minute!\'94 he shrieked excitedly, whilst with frantic haste he\
began fidgeting, fidgeting again at that eternal bit of string. \'93These\
did exist, otherwise why did Lady de Chavasse parley with Pamela\
Pebmarsh? Why did she not order her out of the house then and there,\
if she had nothing to fear from her?\'94\
\
\'93I admit that,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93Very well; then, as she was too fine, too delicate to commit the\
villainous murder of which she afterwards accused poor Miss Pamela,\
who was there sufficiently interested in those letters to try and gain\
possession of them for her?\'94\
\
\'93Who, indeed?\'94 I queried, still puzzled, still not understanding.\
\
\'93Ay! who but her husband,\'94 shrieked the funny creature, as with a\
sharp snap he broke his beloved string in two.\
\
\'93Her husband!\'94 I gasped.\
\
\'93Why not? He had plenty of time, plenty of pluck. In a flat it is easy\
enough to overhear conversations that take place in the next room\'97he\
was in the house at the time, remember, for Lady de Chavasse said\
herself that he went out afterwards. No doubt he overheard\
everything\'97the compromising letters, and Pamela\'92s attempt at levying\
blackmail. What the effect of such a discovery must have been upon the\
proud man I leave you to imagine\'97his wife\'92s social position ruined, a\
stain upon his ancient name, his relations pointing the finger of\
scorn at his folly.\
\
\'93Can\'92t you picture him, hearing the two women\'92s talk in the next room,\
and then resolving at all costs to possess himself of those\
compromising letters? He had just time to catch the 10 train to\
Boreham Wood.\
\
\'93Mind you, I don\'92t suppose that he went down there with any evil\
intent. Most likely he only meant to buy those letters from Miss\
Pebmarsh. What happened, however, nobody can say but the murderer\
himself.\
\
\'93Who knows? But the deed done, imagine the horror of a refined\
aristocratic man, face to face with such a crime as that.\
\
\'93Was it this terror, or merely rage at the girl who had been the\
original cause of all this, that prompted him to commit the final\
villany of writing out a false accusation and placing it under the\
dead woman\'92s hand? Who can tell?\
\
\'93Then, the deed done, and the _mise-en-sc\'e8ne_ complete, he is able to\
catch the last train\'9711.23\'97back to town. A man travelling alone would\
pass practically unperceived.\
\
\'93Pamela\'92s innocence was proved, and the murder of Miss Pebmarsh has\
remained a mystery, but if you will reflect on my conclusions, you\
will admit that no one else\'97_no one else_\'97could have committed that\
murder, for no one else had a greater interest in the destruction of\
those letters.\'94\
\
\
\
VI. The Lisson Grove Mystery\
\
Chapter I\
\
The man in the corner ordered another glass of milk, and timidly asked\
for a second cheese-cake at the same time.\
\
\'93I am going down to Marylebone Police Court, to see those people\
brought up before the \'91Beak,\'92\'94 he remarked.\
\
\'93What people?\'94 I queried.\
\
\'93What people!\'94 he exclaimed, in the greatest excitement. \'93You don\'92t\
mean to say that you have not studied the Lisson Grove Mystery?\'94\
\
I had to confess that my knowledge on that subject was of the most\
superficial character.\
\
\'93One of the most interesting cases that has cropped up in recent\
years,\'94 he said, with an indescribable look of reproach.\
\
\'93Perhaps. I did not study it in the papers because I preferred to hear\
_you_ tell me all about it,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93Oh, if that\'92s it,\'94 he replied, as he settled himself down in his\
corner like a great bird after the rain, \'93then you showed more sense\
than lady journalists usually possess. I can, of course, give you a\
far clearer account than the newspapers have done; as for the\
police\'97well! I never saw such a muddle as they are making of this\
case.\'94\
\
\'93I daresay it is a peculiarly difficult one,\'94 I retorted, for I am\
ever a champion of that hard-working department.\
\
\'93H\'92m!\'94 he said, \'93so, so\'97it is a tragedy in a prologue and three acts.\
I am going down this afternoon to see the curtain fall for the third\
time on what, if I mistake not, will prove a good burlesque; but it\
all began dramatically enough. It was last Saturday, 21st November,\
that two boys, playing in the little spinney just outside Wembley Park\
Station, came across three large parcels done up in American cloth.\
\
\'93With the curiosity natural to their age, they at once proceeded to\
undo these parcels, and what they found so upset the little beggars\
that they ran howling through the spinney and the polo ground,\
straight as a dart to Wembley Park Station. Half frantic with\
excitement, they told their tale to one of the porters off duty, who\
walked back to the spinney with them. The three parcels, in point of\
fact, contained the remains of a dismembered human body. The porter\
sent one of the boys for the local police, and the remains were duly\
conveyed to the mortuary, where they were kept for identification.\
\
\'93Three days later\'97that is to say, on Tuesday, 24th November\'97Miss\
Amelia Dyke, residing at Lisson Grove Crescent, returned from\
Edinburgh, where she had spent three or four days with a friend. She\
drove up from St. Pancras in a cab, and carried her small box up\
herself to the door of the flat, at which she knocked loudly and\
repeatedly\'97so loudly and so persistently, in fact, that the\
inhabitants of the neighbouring flats came out on to their respective\
landings to see what the noise was about.\
\
\'93Miss Amelia Dyke was getting anxious. Her father, she said, must be\
seriously ill, or else why did he not come and open the door to her.\
Her anxiety, however, reached its culminating point when Mr. and Mrs.\
Pitt, who reside in the flat immediately beneath that occupied by the\
Dykes, came forward with the alarming statement that, as a matter of\
fact, they had themselves been wondering if anything were wrong with\
old Mr. Dyke, as they had not heard any sound overhead for the last\
few days.\
\
\'93Miss Amelia, now absolutely terrified, begged one of the neighbours\
to fetch either the police or a locksmith, or both. Mr. Pitt ran out\
at once, both police and locksmith were brought upon the scene, the\
door was forcibly opened, and amidst indescribable excitement\
Constable Turner, followed by Miss Dyke, who was faint and trembling\
with apprehension, effected an entrance into the flat.\
\
\'93Everything in it was tidy and neat to a degree, all the fires were\
laid, the beds made, the floors were clean and washed, the brasses\
polished, only a slight, very slight layer of dust lay over\
everything, dust that could not have accumulated for more than a few\
days. The flat consisted of four rooms and a bathroom; in not one of\
them was there the faintest trace of old Mr. Dyke.\
\
\'93In order to fully comprehend the consternation which all the\
neighbours felt at this discovery,\'94 continued the man in the corner,\
\'93you must understand that old Mr. Dyke was a helpless cripple; he had\
been a mining engineer in his young days, and a terrible blasting\
accident deprived him, at the age of forty, of both legs. They had\
been amputated just above the knee, and the unfortunate man\'97then a\
widower with one little girl\'97had spent the remainder of his life on\
crutches. He had a small\'97a very small pension, which, as soon as his\
daughter Amelia was grown up, had enabled him to live in comparative\
comfort in the small flat in Lisson Grove Crescent.\
\
\'93His misfortune, however, had left him terribly sensitive; he never\
could bear the looks of compassion thrown upon him, whenever he\
ventured out on his crutches, and even the kindliest sympathy was\
positive torture to him. Gradually, therefore, as he got on in life,\
he took to staying more and more at home, and after a while gave up\
going out altogether. By the time he was sixty-five years old and Miss\
Amelia a fine young woman of seven-and-twenty, old Dyke had not been\
outside the door of his flat for at least five years.\
\
\'93And yet, when Constable Turner, aided by the locksmith, entered the\
flat on that memorable 24th November, there was not a trace anywhere\
of the old man.\
\
\'93Miss Amelia was in the last stages of despair, and at first she\
seemed far too upset and hysterical to give the police any coherent\
and definite information. At last, however, from amid the chaos of\
tears and of ejaculations, Constable Turner gathered the following\
facts:\
\
\'93Miss Amelia had some great friends in Edinburgh, whom she had long\
wished to visit, her father\'92s crippled condition making this extremely\
difficult. A fortnight ago however, in response to a very urgent\
invitation, she at last decided to accept it, but in order to leave\
her father altogether comfortable, she advertised in the local paper\
for a respectable woman who would come to the flat every day and see\
to all the work, cook his dinner, make the bed, and so on.\
\
\'93She had several applications in reply to this advertisement, and\
ultimately selected a very worthy-looking elderly person, who, for\
seven shillings a week, undertook to come daily from seven in the\
morning until about six in the afternoon, to see to all Mr. Dyke\'92s\
comforts.\
\
\'93Miss Amelia was very favourably impressed with this person\'92s\
respectable and motherly appearance, and she left for Edinburgh by the\
5.15 a.m. train on the morning of Thursday, 19th November, feeling\
confident that her father would be well looked after. She certainly\
had not heard from the old man while she was away, but she had not\
expected to hear unless, indeed, something had been wrong.\
\
\'93Miss Amelia was quite sure that something dreadful had happened to\
her father, as he could not possibly have walked downstairs and out of\
the house alone; certainly his crutches were nowhere to be found, but\
this only helped to deepen the mystery of the old man\'92s disappearance.\
\
\'93The constable, having got thus far with his notes, thought it best to\
refer the whole matter at this stage to higher authority. He got from\
Miss Amelia the name and address of the charwoman, and then went back\
to the station.\
\
\'93There, the very first news that greeted him was that the medical\
officer of the district had just sent round to the various police\
stations his report on the human remains found in Wembley Park the\
previous Saturday. They had proved to be the dismembered body of an\
old man between sixty and seventy years of age, the immediate cause of\
whose death had undoubtedly been a violent blow on the back of the\
head with a heavy instrument, which had shattered the cranium. Expert\
examination further revealed the fact that deceased had had in early\
life both legs removed by a surgical operation just above the knee.\
\
\'93That was the end of the prologue in the Lisson Grove tragedy,\'94\
continued the man in the corner, after a slight and dramatic pause,\
\'93as far as the public was concerned. When the curtain was subsequently\
raised upon the first act, the situation had been considerably\
changed.\
\
\'93The remains had been positively identified as those of old Mr. Dyke,\
and a charge of wilful murder had been brought against Alfred Wyatt,\
of no occupation, residing in Warlock Road, Lisson Grove, and against\
Amelia Dyke for complicity in the crime. They are the two people whom\
I am going to see this afternoon brought before the Beak at the\
Marylebone Police Court.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93Two very important bits of evidence, I must tell you, had come to\
light, on the first day of the inquest, and had decided the police to\
make this double arrest.\
\
\'93In the first place, according to one or two of the neighbours, who\
happened to know something of the Dyke household, Miss Amelia had kept\
company for some time with a young man named Alfred Wyatt; he was an\
electrical engineer, resided in the neighbourhood, and was some years\
younger than Miss Dyke. As he was known not to be very steady, it was\
generally supposed that the old man did not altogether approve of his\
daughter\'92s engagement.\
\
\'93Mrs. Pitt, residing in the flat immediately below the one occupied by\
the Dykes, had stated, moreover, that on Wednesday the 18th, at about\
midday, she heard very loud and angry voices proceeding from above;\
Miss Amelia\'92s shrill tones being specially audible. Shortly afterwards\
she saw Wyatt go out of the house; but the quarrel continued for some\
little time without him, for the neighbours could still hear Miss\
Amelia\'92s high-pitched voice, speaking very excitedly and volubly.\
\
\'93\'91An hour later,\'92 further explained Mrs. Pitt, \'91I met Miss Dyke on the\
stairs; she seemed very flushed and looked as if she had been crying.\
I suppose she saw that I noticed this, for she stopped and said to me:\
\
\'93\'91\'93All this fuss, you know, Mrs. Pitt, because Alfred asked me to go\
for a drive with him this afternoon, but I am going all the same.\'94\
\
\'93\'91Later in the afternoon\'97it must have been quite half-past four, for\
it was getting dark\'97young Wyatt drove up in a motor-car, and presently\
I heard Miss Dyke\'92s voice on the stairs saying very pleasantly and\
cheerfully: \'93All right, daddy, we shan\'92t be long.\'94 Then Mr. Dyke must\
have said something, which I didn\'92t hear, for she added. \'93Oh, that\'92s\
all right; I am well wrapped up, and we have plenty of rugs.\'94\'92\
\
\'93Mrs. Pitt then went to her window and saw Wyatt and Amelia Dyke start\
off in a motor. She concluded that the old man had been mollified, for\
both Amelia and Wyatt waved their hands affectionately up towards the\
window. They returned from their drive about six o\'92clock; Wyatt saw\
Amelia to the door, and then went off again. The next day Miss Dyke\
went to Scotland.\
\
\'93As you see,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93Alfred Wyatt had\
become a very important personality in this case; he was Amelia\'92s\
sweetheart, and it was strange\'97to say the least of it\'97that she had\
never as yet even mentioned his name. Therefore, when she was recalled\
in order to give further evidence, you may be sure that she was pretty\
sharply questioned on the subject of Alfred Wyatt.\
\
\'93In her evidence before the coroner, she adhered fairly closely to her\
original statement:\
\
\'93\'91I did not mention Mr. Wyatt\'92s name,\'92 she explained, \'91because I did\
not think it was of any importance; if he knew anything about my dead\
father\'92s mysterious fate he would have come forward at once, of\
course, and helped me to find out who the cowardly murderer was who\
could attack a poor, crippled old man. Mr. Wyatt was devoted to my\
father, and it is perfectly ridiculous to say that daddy objected to\
my engagement; on the contrary, he gave us his full consent, and we\
were going to be married directly after the New Year, and continue to\
live with father in the flat.\'92\
\
\'93\'91But,\'92 questioned the coroner, who had not by any means departed from\
his severity, \'91what about this quarrel which the last witness\
overheard on the subject of your going out driving with Mr. Wyatt?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh, that was nothing,\'92 replied Miss Dyke very quietly. \'91Daddy only\
objected because he thought that it was rather too late to start at\
four o\'92clock, and that I should be cold. When he saw that we had\
plenty of rugs he was quite pleased for me to go.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Isn\'92t it rather astonishing, then,\'92 asked the coroner, \'91seeing that\
Mr. Wyatt was on such good terms with your father, that he did not go\
to see him while you were away?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Not at all,\'92 she replied unconcernedly; \'91Alfred went down to\
Edinburgh on the Thursday evening. He couldn\'92t travel with me in the\
morning, for he had some business to see to in town that day; but he\
joined me at my friends\'92 house on the Friday morning, having travelled\
all night.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Ah!\'92 remarked the coroner drily, \'91then he had not seen your father\
since you left.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh, yes,\'92 said Miss Amelia; \'91he called round to see dad during the\
day, and found him looking well and cheerful.\'92\
\
\'93Miss Amelia Dyke, as she gave this evidence, seemed absolutely\
unconscious of saying anything that might in any way incriminate her\
lover. She is a handsome, though somewhat coarse-looking woman, nearer\
thirty, I should say, than she would care to own. I was present at the\
inquest, mind you, for that case had too many mysteries about it from\
the first for it to have eluded my observation, and I watched her\
closely throughout. Her voice struck me as fine and rich, with\'97in this\
instance, also\'97a shade of coarseness in it; certainly, it was very far\
from being high-pitched, as Mrs. Pitt had described it.\
\
\'93When she had finished her evidence she went back to her seat, looking\
neither flustered nor uncomfortable, although many looks of contempt\
and even of suspicion were darted at her from every corner of the\
crowded court.\
\
\'93Nor did she lose her composure in the slightest degree when Mr.\
Parlett, clerk to Messrs. Snow and Patterson, solicitors, of Bedford\
Row, in his turn came forward and gave evidence; only while the little\
man spoke her full red lips curled and parted with a look of complete\
contempt.\
\
\'93Mr. Parlett\'92s story was indeed a remarkable one, inasmuch as it\
suddenly seemed to tear asunder the veil of mystery which so far had\
surrounded the murder of old Dyke by supplying it with a motive\'97a\
strong motive too: the eternal greed of gain.\
\
\'93In June last, namely, it appears that Messrs. Snow and Patterson\
received intimation from a firm of Melbourne solicitors that a man of\
the name of Dyke had died there recently, leaving a legacy of \'a34,000\
to his only brother James Arthur Dyke, a mining engineer, who in 1890\
was residing at Lisson Grove Crescent. The Melbourne solicitors in\
their communication asked for Messrs. Snow and Patterson\'92s kind\
assistance in helping them to find the legatee.\
\
\'93The search was easy enough, since James Arthur Dyke, mining engineer,\
had never ceased to reside at Lisson Grove Crescent. Armed, therefore,\
with full instructions from their Melbourne correspondent, Messrs.\
Snow and Patterson communicated with Dyke, and after a little\
preliminary correspondence, the sum of \'a34,000 in Bank of Australia\
notes and various securities were handed over by Mr. Parlett to the\
old cripple.\
\
\'93The money and securities were\'97so Mr. Parlett understood\'97subsequently\
deposited by Mr. Dyke at the Portland Road Branch of the London and\
South Western Bank; as the old man apparently died intestate, the\
whole of the \'a34,000 would naturally devolve upon his only daughter and\
natural legatee.\
\
\'93Mind you, all through the proceedings the public had instinctively\
felt that money was somewhere at the bottom of this gruesome and\
mysterious crime. There is not much object in murdering an old cripple\
except for purposes of gain, but now Mr. Parlett\'92s evidence had indeed\
furnished a damning motive for the appalling murder.\
\
\'93What more likely than that Alfred Wyatt, wanting to finger that\
\'a34,000, had done away with the old man? And if Amelia Dyke did not\
turn away from him in horror, after such a cowardly crime, then she\
must have known of it and had perhaps connived in it.\
\
\'93As for Nicholson, the charwoman, her evidence had certainly done more\
to puzzle everybody all round than any other detail in this strange\
and mysterious crime.\
\
\'93She deposed that on Friday, 13th November, in answer to an\
advertisement in the _Marylebone Star_, she had called on Miss Dyke at\
Lisson Grove, when it was arranged that she should do a week\'92s work at\
the flat, beginning Thursday, the 19th, from seven in the morning\
until six in the afternoon. She was to keep the place clean, get Mr.\
Dyke\'97who, she understood was an invalid\'97all his meals, and make\
herself generally useful to him.\
\
\'93Accordingly, Nicholson turned up on the Thursday morning. She let\
herself into the flat, as Miss Dyke had entrusted the latch-key to\
her, and went on with the work. Mr. Dyke was in bed, and she got him\
all his meals that day. She thought she was giving him satisfaction,\
and was very astonished when, at six o\'92clock, having cleared away his\
tea, he told her that he would not require her again. He gave her no\
explanation, asked her for the latch-key, and gave her her full week\'92s\
money\'97seven shillings in full. Nicholson then put on her bonnet, and\
went away.\
\
\'93Now,\'94 continued the man in the corner, leaning excitedly forward, and\
marking each sentence he uttered with an exquisitely complicated knot\
in his bit of string, \'93an hour later, another neighbour, Mrs. Marsh,\
who lived on the same floor as the Dykes, on starting to go out, met\
Alfred Wyatt on the landing. He took off his hat to her, and then\
knocked at the door of the Dykes\'92 flat.\
\
\'93When she came home at eight o\'92clock, she again passed him on the\
stairs; he was then going out. She stopped to ask him how Mr. Dyke\
was, and Wyatt replied: \'91Oh, fairly well, but he misses his daughter,\
you know.\'92\
\
\'93Mrs. Marsh, now closely questioned, said that she thought Wyatt was\
carrying a large parcel under his arm, but she could not distinguish\
the shape of the parcel as the angle of the stairs, where she met him,\
was very dark. She stated, though, that he was running down the stairs\
very fast.\
\
\'93It was on all that evidence that the police felt justified in\
arresting Alfred Wyatt for the murder of James Arthur Dyke, and Amelia\
Dyke for connivance in the crime. And now this very morning, those two\
young people have been brought before the magistrate, and at this\
moment evidence\'97circumstantial, mind you, but positively damning\'97is\
being heaped upon them by the prosecution. The police did their work\
quickly. The very evening after the first day of the inquest, the\
warrant was out for their arrest.\'94\
\
He looked at a huge silver watch which he always carried in his\
waistcoat pocket.\
\
\'93I don\'92t want to miss the defence,\'94 he said, \'93for I know that it will\
be sensational. But I did not want to hear the police and medical\
evidence all over again. You\'92ll excuse me, won\'92t you? I shall be back\
here for five o\'92clock tea. I know you will be glad to hear all about\
it.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
When I returned to the A.B.C shop for my tea at five minutes past\
five, there he sat in his accustomed corner, with a cup of tea before\
him, another placed opposite to him, presumably for me, and a long\
piece of string between his bony fingers.\
\
\'93What will you have with your tea?\'94 he asked politely, the moment I\
was seated.\
\
\'93A roll and butter and the end of the story,\'94 I replied.\
\
\'93Oh, the story has no end,\'94 he said with a chuckle; \'93at least, not for\
the public. As for me, why, I never met a more simple \'91mystery.\'92\
Perhaps that is why the police were so completely at sea.\'94\
\
\'93Well, and what happened?\'94 I queried, with some impatience.\
\
\'93Why, the usual thing,\'94 he said, as he once more began to fidget\
nervously with his bit of string. \'93The prisoners had pleaded not\
guilty, and the evidence for the prosecution was gone into in full.\
Mr. Parlett repeated his story of the \'a34,000 legacy, and all the\
neighbours had some story or other to tell about Alfred Wyatt, who,\
according to them, was altogether a most undesirable young man.\
\
\'93I heard the fag end of Mrs. Marsh\'92s evidence. When I reached the\
court she was repeating the story she had already told to the police.\
\
\'93Some one else in the house had also heard Wyatt running\
helter-skelter downstairs at eight o\'92clock on the Thursday evening;\
this was a point, though a small one, in favour of the accused. A man\
cannot run downstairs when he is carrying the whole weight of a dead\
body, and the theory of the prosecution was that Wyatt had murdered\
old Dyke on that Thursday evening, got into his motor-car somewhere,\
scorched down to Wembley with the dismembered body of his victim,\
deposited it in the spinney where it was subsequently found, and\
finally had driven back to town, stabled his motor car, and reached\
King\'92s Cross in time for the 11.30 night express to Edinburgh. He\
would have time for all that, remember, for he would have three hours\
and a half to do it in.\
\
\'93Besides which the prosecution had unearthed one more witness, who was\
able to add another tiny link to the already damning chain of evidence\
built up against the accused.\
\
\'93Wilfred Poad, namely, manager of a large cycle and motor-car dep\'f4t in\
Euston Road, stated that on Thursday afternoon, 19th November, at\
about half-past six o\'92clock, Alfred Wyatt, with whom he had had some\
business dealings before, had hired a small car from him, with the\
understanding that he need not bring it back until after 11 p.m. This\
was agreed to, Poad keeping the place open until just before eleven,\
when Wyatt drove up in the car, paid for the hire of it, and then\
walked away from the shop in the direction of the Great Northern\
terminus.\
\
\'93That was pretty strong against the male prisoner, wasn\'92t it? For,\
mind you, Wyatt had given no satisfactory account whatever of his time\
between 8 p.m., when Mrs. Marsh had met him going out of Lisson Grove\
Crescent, and 11 p.m. when he brought back the car to the Euston Road\
shop. \'91He had been driving about aimlessly,\'92 so he said. Now, one\
doesn\'92t go out motoring for hours on a cold, drizzly night in November\
for no purpose whatever.\
\
\'93As for the female prisoner, the charge against her was merely one of\
complicity.\
\
\'93This closed the case for the prosecution,\'94 continued the funny\
creature, with one of his inimitable chuckles, \'93leaving but one tiny\
point obscure, and that was, the murdered man\'92s strange conduct in\
dismissing the woman Nicholson.\
\
\'93Yes, the case was strong enough, and yet there stood both prisoners\
in the dock with that sublime air of indifference and contempt which\
only complete innocence or hardened guilt could give.\
\
\'93Then when the prosecution had had their say, Alfred Wyatt chose to\
enter the witness-box and make a statement in his own defence.\
Quietly, and as if he were making the most casual observation, he\
said:\
\
\'93\'91I am not guilty of the murder of Mr. Dyke, and in proof of this I\
solemnly assert that on Thursday, 19th November, the day I am supposed\
to have committed the crime, the old man was still alive at half-past\
ten o\'92clock in the evening.\'92\
\
\'93He paused a moment, like a born actor, watching the effect he had\
produced. I tell you, it was astounding.\
\
\'93\'91I have three separate and independent witnesses here,\'92 continued\
Wyatt, with the same deliberate calm, \'91who heard and saw Mr. Dyke as\
late as half-past ten that night. Now, I understand that the\
dismembered body of the old man was found close to Wembley Park. How\
could I, between half-past ten and eleven o\'92clock, have killed Dyke,\
cut him up, cleaned and put the flat all tidy, carried the body to the\
car, driven on to Wembley, hidden the corpse in the spinney, and be\
back in Euston Road, all in the space of half-an-hour? I am absolutely\
innocent of this crime, and fortunately, it is easy for me now to\
prove my innocence.\'92\
\
\'93Alfred Wyatt had made no idle boast. Mrs. Marsh had seen him running\
downstairs at 8 p.m. An hour after that, the Pitts in the flat beneath\
heard the old man moving about overhead.\
\
\'93\'91Just as usual,\'92 observed Mrs. Pitt. \'91He always went to bed about\
nine, and we could always hear him most distinctly.\'92\
\
\'93John Pitt, the husband, corroborated this statement: the old man\'92s\
movements were quite unmistakable because of his crutches.\
\
\'93Henry Ogden, on the other hand, who lived in the house facing the\
block of flats, saw the light in Dyke\'92s window that evening, and the\
old man\'92s silhouette upon the blind from time to time. The light was\
put out at half-past ten. This statement again was corroborated by\
Mrs. Ogden, who also had noticed the silhouette and the light being\
extinguished at half-past ten.\
\
\'93But this was not all; both Mr. and Mrs. Ogden had seen old Dyke at\
his window, sitting in his accustomed armchair, between half-past\
eight and nine o\'92clock. He was gesticulating, and apparently talking\
to some one else in the room whom they could not see.\
\
\'93Alfred Wyatt, therefore was quite right when he said that he would\
have no difficulty in proving his innocence. The man whom he was\
supposed to have murdered was, according to the testimony, alive at\
six o\'92clock; according to Mr. and Mrs. Ogden he was alive and sitting\
in his window until nine; again, he was heard to move about until ten\
o\'92clock by both the Pitts, and at half-past ten only was the light put\
out in his flat. Obviously, therefore, as his dead body was found\
twelve miles away, Wyatt, who was out of the Crescent at eight, and in\
Euston Road at eleven, could not have done the deed.\
\
\'93He was discharged, of course; the magistrate adding a very severe\
remark on the subject of \'91carelessly collected evidence.\'92 As for Miss\
Amelia, she sailed out of the court like a queen after her coronation,\
for with Wyatt\'92s discharge the case against her naturally collapsed.\
As for me, I walked out too, with an elated feeling at the thought\
that the intelligence of the British race had not yet sunk so low as\
our friends on the Continent would have us believe.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93But then, who murdered the old man?\'94 I asked, for I confess the\
matter was puzzling me in an irritating kind of way.\
\
\'93Ah! who indeed?\'94 he rejoined sarcastically, while an artistic knot\
went to join its fellows along that never-ending bit of string.\
\
\'93I wish you\'92d tell me what\'92s in your mind,\'94 I said, feeling peculiarly\
irritated with him just at that moment.\
\
\'93What\'92s in my mind?\'94 he replied, with a shrug of his thin shoulders.\
\'93Oh, only a certain degree of admiration!\'94\
\
\'93Admiration at what?\'94\
\
\'93At a pair of exceedingly clever criminals.\'94\
\
\'93Then you do think that Wyatt murdered Dyke?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t think\'97I am sure.\'94\
\
\'93But when did they do it?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, that\'92s more to the point. Personally, I should say between them\
on Wednesday morning, 18th November.\'94\
\
\'93The day they went for that motor-car ride?\'94 I gasped.\
\
\'93And carried away the old man\'92s remains beneath a multiplicity of\
rugs,\'94 he added.\
\
\'93But he was _alive_ long after that!\'94 I urged. \'93The woman Nicholson\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93The woman Nicholson saw and spoke to a man in bed, whom she\
_supposed_ was old Mr. Dyke. Among the many questions put to her by\
those clever detectives, no one thought, of course, of asking her to\
describe the old man. But even if she had done so Wyatt was far too\
great an artist in crime not to have contrived a make-up which,\
described by a witness who had never before seen Dyke, would easily\
pass as a description of the old man himself.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94 I said, struck in spite of myself by the simplicity of\
his logic.\
\
\'93Impossible, you say?\'94 he shrieked excitedly. \'93Why, I call that crime\
a masterpiece from beginning to end; a display of ingenuity which,\
fortunately, the criminal classes seldom possess, or where would\
society be? Here was a crime committed, where everything was most\
beautifully stage-managed, nothing left unforeseen. Shall I\
reconstruct it for you?\'94\
\
\'93Do!\'94 I said, handing across the table to him a brand new, beautiful\
bit of string, on which his talon-like fingers fastened as upon a\
prey.\
\
\'93Very well,\'94 he said, marking each point with a scientific knot. \'93Here\
it is, scene by scene: There was Alfred Wyatt and Amelia Dyke\'97a pair\
of blackguards, eager to obtain that \'a34,000 which only the old man\'92s\
death could secure for them. They decide upon killing him, and: Scene\
1\'97Miss Amelia makes _her_ arrangements. She advertises for a\
charwoman, and engages one, who is to be a very useful witness\
presently.\
\
\'93Scene 2.\'97The murder, brutal, horrible, on the person of an old\
cripple, whilst his own daughter stands by, and the dismembering of\
the body.\
\
\'93Scene 3.\'97The ride in the motor-car\'97after dark, remember, and with\
plenty of rugs, beneath which the gruesome burden is concealed. The\
scene is accompanied by the comedy of Miss Dyke speaking to her\
father, and waving her hand affectionately at him from below. I tell\
you, that woman must have had some nerve!\
\
\'93Then, Scene 4.\'97The arrival at Wembley, and the hiding of the remains.\
\
\'93Scene 5.\'97Amelia goes to Edinburgh by the 5.15 a.m. train, and thus\
secures her own _alibi_. After that, the comedy begins in earnest. The\
impersonation of the dead man by Wyatt during the whole of that\
memorable Thursday. Mind you, that was not very difficult; it only\
needed the brain to invent, and the nerve to carry it through. The\
charwoman had never seen old Dyke before; she only knew that he was an\
invalid. What more natural than that she should accept as her new\
master the man who lay in bed all day, and only spoke a few words to\
her? A very slight make-up of hair and beard would complete the\
illusion.\
\
\'93Then, at six o\'92clock, the woman gone, Wyatt steals out of the house,\
bespeaks the motor-car, leaves it in the street in a convenient spot,\
and is back in time to be seen by Mrs. Marsh at seven.\
\
\'93The rest is simplicity itself. The silhouette at the window was easy\
enough to arrange; the sound of a man walking on crutches is easily\
imitated with a couple of umbrellas\'97the actual crutches were, no\
doubt, burned directly after the murder. Lastly, the putting out of\
the light at half-past ten was the crowning stroke of genius.\
\
\'93One little thing might have upset the whole wonderful plan, but that\
one thing only; and that was if the body had been found _before_ the\
great comedy scene of Thursday had been fully played. But that spinney\
near Wembley was well chosen. People don\'92t go wandering under trees\
and in woods on cold November days, and the remains were not found\
until the Saturday.\
\
\'93Ah, it was cleverly stage-managed, and no mistake. I couldn\'92t have\
done it better myself. Won\'92t you have another cup of tea? No? Don\'92t\
look so upset. The world does not contain many such clever criminals\
as Alfred Wyatt and Amelia Dyke.\'94\
\
\
\
VII. The Tremarn Case\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93Well, it certainly is most amazing!\'94 I said that day, when I had\
finished reading about it all in the _Daily Telegraph_.\
\
\'93Yet the most natural thing in the world,\'94 retorted the man in the\
corner, as soon as he had ordered his lunch. \'93Crime invariably begets\
crime. No sooner is a murder, theft, or fraud committed in a novel or\
striking way, than this method is aped\'97probably within the next few\
days\'97by some other less imaginative scoundrel.\
\
\'93Take this case, for instance,\'94 he continued, as he slowly began\
sipping his glass of milk, \'93which seems to amaze you so much. It was\
less than a year ago, was it not? that in Paris a man was found dead\
in a cab, stabbed in a most peculiar way\'97right through the neck from\
ear to ear\'97with, presumably, a long, sharp instrument of the type of\
an Italian stiletto.\
\
\'93No one in England took much count of the crime, beyond a contemptuous\
shrug of the shoulders at the want of safety of the Paris streets, and\
the incapacity of the French detectives, who not only never discovered\
the murderer, who had managed to slip out of the cab unperceived, but\
who did not even succeed in establishing the identity of the victim.\
\
\'93But this case,\'94 he added, pointing once more to my daily paper,\
\'93strikes nearer home. Less than a year has passed, and last week, in\
the very midst of our much vaunted London streets, a crime of a\
similar nature has been committed. I do not know if your paper gives\
full details, but this is what happened: Last Monday evening two\
gentlemen, both in evening dress and wearing opera hats, hailed a\
hansom in Shaftesbury Avenue. It was about a quarter past eleven, and\
the night, if you remember, was a typical November one\'97dark, drizzly,\
and foggy. The various theatres in the immediate neighbourhood were\
disgorging a continuous stream of people after the evening\
performance.\
\
\'93The cabman did not take special notice of his fares. They jumped in\
very quickly, and one of them, through the little trap above, gave him\
an address in Cromwell Road. He drove there as quickly as the fog\
would permit him, and pulled up at the number given. One of the\
gentlemen then handed him a very liberal fare\'97again through the little\
trap\'97and told him to drive his friend on to Westminster Chambers,\
Victoria Street.\
\
\'93Cabby noticed that the \'91swell,\'92 when he got out of the hansom,\
stopped for a moment to say a few words to his friend, who had\
remained inside; then he crossed over the road and walked quickly in\
the direction of the Natural History Museum.\
\
\'93When the cabman pulled up at Westminster Chambers, he waited for the\
second fare to get out; the latter seemingly making no movement that\
way, cabby looked down at him through the trap.\
\
\'93\'91I thought \'92e was asleep,\'92 he explained to the police later on. \'91\'92E\
was leaning back in \'92is corner, and \'92is \'92ead was turned towards the\
window. I gets down and calls to \'92im, but \'92e don\'92t move. Then I gets\
on to the step and give \'92im a shake. . . . There!\'97I\'92ll say no\
more. . . . We was near a lamp-post, the mare took a step forward, and\
the light fell full on the gent\'92s face. \'92E was dead and no mistake. I\
saw the wound just underneath \'92is ear, and \'93Murder!\'94 I says to myself\
at once.\'92\
\
\'93Cabby lost no time in whistling for the nearest point policeman, then\
he called the night porter of the Westminster Chambers. The latter\
looked at the murdered man, and declared that he knew nothing of him;\
certainly he was not a tenant of the Chambers.\
\
\'93By the time a couple of policemen arrived upon the scene, quite a\
crowd had gathered around the cab, in spite of the lateness of the\
hour and the darkness of the night. The matter was such an important\
one that one of the constables thought it best at once to jump into\
the hansom beside the murdered man and to order the cabman to drive to\
the nearest police station.\
\
\'93There the cause of death was soon ascertained; the victim of this\
daring outrage had been stabbed through the neck from ear to ear with\
a long, sharp instrument, in shape like an antique stiletto, which, I\
may tell you, was subsequently found under the cushions of the hansom.\
The murderer must have watched his opportunity, when his victim\'92s head\
was turned away from him, and then dealt the blow, just below the left\
ear, with amazing swiftness and precision.\
\
\'93Of course the papers were full of it the next day; this was such a\
lovely opportunity for driving home a moral lesson, of how one crime\
engenders another, and how\'97but for that murder in Paris a year ago\'97we\
should not now have to deplore a crime committed in the very centre of\
fashionable London, the detection of which seems likely to completely\
baffle the police.\
\
\'93Plenty more in that strain, of course, from which the reading public\
quickly jumped to the conclusion that the police held absolutely no\
clue as to the identity of the daring and mysterious miscreant.\
\
\'93A most usual and natural thing had happened; cabby could only give a\
very vague description of his other \'91fare,\'92 of the \'91swell\'92 who had got\
out at Cromwell Road, and been lost to sight after having committed so\
dastardly and so daring a crime.\
\
\'93This was scarcely to be wondered at, for the night had been very\
foggy, and the murderer had been careful to pull his opera hat well\
over his face; thus hiding the whole of his forehead and eyes;\
moreover, he had always taken the additional precaution of only\
communicating with the cabman through the little trap-door.\
\
\'93All cabby had seen of him was a clean-shaven chin. As to the murdered\
man, it was not until about noon, when the early editions of the\
evening papers came out with a fuller account of the crime and a\
description of the victim, that his identity was at last established.\
\
\'93Then the news spread like wildfire, and the evening papers came out\
with some of the most sensational headlines it had ever been their\
good fortune to print. The man who had been so mysteriously murdered\
in the cab was none other than Mr. Philip Le Cheminant, the nephew and\
heir-presumptive of the Earl of Tremarn.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93In order fully to realise the interest created by this extraordinary\
news, you must be acquainted with the various details of that\
remarkable case, popularly known as the \'91Tremarn Peerage Case,\'92\'94\
continued the man in the corner, as he placidly munched his\
cheese-cake. \'93I do not know if you followed it in its earlier stages,\
when its many details\'97which read like a romance\'97were first made\
public.\'94\
\
I looked so interested and so eager that he did not wait for my reply.\
\
\'93I must try and put it all clearly before you,\'94 he said; \'93I was\
interested in it all from the beginning, and from the numerous wild\
stories afloat I have sifted only what was undeniably true. Some\
points of the case are still in dispute, and will, perhaps, now for\
ever remain a mystery. But I must take you back some five-and-twenty\
years. The Hon. Arthur Le Cheminant, second son of the late Earl of\
Tremarn, was then travelling round the world for health and pleasure.\
\
\'93In the course of his wanderings he touched at Martinique, one of the\
French West Indian islands, which was devastated by volcanic eruptions\
about two years ago. There he met and fell in love with a beautiful\
half-caste girl named Lucie Legrand, who had French blood in her\
veins, and was a Christian, but who, otherwise, was only partially\
civilised, and not at all educated.\
\
\'93How it all came about it is difficult to conjecture, but one thing is\
absolutely certain, and that is that the Hon. Arthur le Cheminant the\
son of one of our English Peers, married this half-caste girl at the\
parish church of St. Pierre, in Martinique, according to the forms\
prescribed by French laws, both parties being of the same religion.\
\
\'93I suppose now no one will ever know whether that marriage was\
absolutely and undisputably a legal one\'97but, in view of subsequent\
events, we must presume that it was. The Hon. Arthur, however, in any\
case, behaved like a young scoundrel. He only spent a very little time\
with his wife, quickly tired of her, and within two years of his\
marriage callously abandoned her and his child, then a boy about a\
year old.\
\
\'93He lodged a sum of \'a32,000 in the local bank in the name of Mme. Le\
Cheminant, the interest of which was to be paid to her regularly for\
the maintenance of herself and child, then he calmly sailed for\
England, with the intention never to return. This intention fate\
itself helped him to carry out, for he died very shortly afterwards,\
taking the secret of his incongruous marriage with him to his grave.\
\
\'93Mme. Le Cheminant, as she was called out there, seems to have\
accepted her own fate with perfect equanimity. She had never known\
anything about her husband\'92s social position in his own country, and\
he had left her what, in Martinique amongst the coloured population,\
was considered a very fair competence for herself and child.\
\
\'93The grandson of an English earl was taught to read and write by the\
worthy _cur\'e9_ of St. Pierre, and during the whole of her life, Lucie\
never once tried to find out who her husband was, and what had become\
of him.\
\
\'93But here the dramatic scene comes in this strange story,\'94 continued\
the man in the corner, with growing excitement; \'93two years ago St.\
Pierre, if you remember, was completely destroyed by volcanic\
eruptions. Nearly the entire population perished, and every house and\
building was in ruins. Among those who fell a victim to the awful\
catastrophe was Mme. Le Cheminant, otherwise the Hon. Mrs. Arthur Le\
Cheminant, whilst amongst those who managed to escape and ultimately\
found refuge in the English colony of St. Vincent, was her son,\
Philip.\
\
\'93Well, you can easily guess what happened, can\'92t you? In that\
English-speaking colony the name of Le Cheminant was, of course, well\
known, and Philip had not been in St. Vincent many weeks, before he\
learned that his father was none other than a younger brother of the\
present Earl of Tremarn, and that he himself\'97seeing that the present\
peer was over fifty and still unmarried\'97was heir-presumptive to the\
title and estates.\
\
\'93You know the rest. Within two or three months of the memorable St.\
Pierre catastrophe Philip Le Cheminant had written to his uncle, Lord\
Tremarn, demanding his rights. Then he took passage on board a French\
liner, and crossed over to Havre _en route_ for Paris and London.\
\
\'93He and his mother\'97both brought up as French subjects\'97had, mind you,\
all the respect which French people have for their papers of\
identification; and when the house in which they had lived for twenty\
years was tumbling about the young man\'92s ears, when his mother had\
already perished in the flames, he made a final and successful effort\
to rescue the papers which proved him to be a French citizen, the son\
of Lucie Legrand by her lawful marriage with Arthur Le Cheminant at\
the church of the Immaculate Conception of St. Pierre.\
\
\'93What happened immediately afterwards it is difficult to conjecture.\
Certain it is, however, that over here the newspapers soon were full\
of vague allusions about the newly-found heir to the Earldom of\
Tremarn, and within a few weeks the whole of the story of the secret\
marriage at St. Pierre was in everybody\'92s mouth.\
\
\'93It created an immense sensation; the Hon. Arthur Le Cheminant had\
lived a few years in England after his return from abroad and no one,\
not even his brother, seemed to have had the slightest inkling of his\
marriage.\
\
\'93The late Lord Tremarn, you must remember, had three sons, the eldest\
of whom is the present peer, the second was the romantic Arthur, and\
the third, the Hon. Reginald, who also died some years ago, leaving\
four sons, the eldest of whom, Harold, was just twenty-three, and had\
always been styled heir-presumptive to the earldom.\
\
\'93Lord Tremarn had brought up these four nephews of his, who had lost\
both father and mother, just as if they had been his own children, and\
his affection for them, and notably for the eldest boy, was a very\
beautiful trait in his otherwise unattractive character.\
\
\'93The news of the existence and claim of this unknown nephew must have\
come upon Lord Tremarn as a thunderbolt. His attitude, however, was\
one of uncompromising incredulity. He refused to believe the story of\
the marriage, called the whole tale a tissue of falsehoods, and\
denounced the claimant as a barefaced and impudent impostor.\
\
\'93Two or three months more went by; the public were eagerly awaiting\
the arrival of this semi-exotic claimant to an English peerage, and\
sensations, surpassing those of the Tichborne case, were looked\
forward to with palpitating interest.\
\
\'93But in the romances of real life, it is always the unexpected that\
happens. The claimant did arrive in London about a year ago. He was\
alone, friendless, and moneyless, since the \'a32,000 lay buried\
somewhere beneath the ruins of the St. Pierre bank. However, he called\
upon a well-known London solicitor, who advanced him some money and\
took charge of all the papers relating to his claim.\
\
\'93Philip Le Cheminant then seems to have made up his mind to make a\
personal appeal to his uncle, trusting apparently in the old adage\
that \'91blood is thicker than water.\'92\
\
\'93As was only to be expected, Lord Tremarn flatly refused to see the\
claimant, whom he was still denouncing as an impostor. It was by\
stealth, and by bribing the servants at the Grosvenor Square mansion\
that the young man at last obtained an interview with his uncle.\
\
\'93Last New Year\'92s Day he gave James Tovey, Lord Tremarn\'92s butler, a\
five-pound note, to introduce him, surreptitiously, into his master\'92s\
study. There uncle and nephew at last met face to face.\
\
\'93What happened at that interview nobody knows; was the cry of blood\
and of justice so convincing that Lord Tremarn dare not resist it?\
Perhaps.\
\
\'93Anyway, from that moment the new heir-presumptive was installed\
within his rights. After a single interview with Philip Le Cheminant\'92s\
solicitor, Lord Tremarn openly acknowledged the claimant to be his\
brother Arthur\'92s only son, and therefore his own nephew and heir.\
\
\'93Nay, more, every one noticed that the proud, bad-tempered old man was\
as wax in the hands of this newly-found nephew. He seemed even to have\
withdrawn his affection from the four other young nephews, whom\
hitherto he had brought up as his own children, and bestowed it all\
upon his brother Arthur\'92s son\'97some people said in compensation for all\
the wrong that had been done to the boy in the past.\
\
\'93But the scandal around his dead brother\'92s name had wounded the old\
man\'92s pride very deeply, and from this he never recovered. He shut\
himself away from all his friends, living alone with his newly-found\
nephew in his gloomy house in Grosvenor Square. The other boys, the\
eldest of whom, Harold, was just twenty-three, decided very soon to\
leave a house where they were no longer welcome. They had a small\
private fortune of their own, from their father and mother; the\
youngest boy was still at college, two others had made a start in\
their respective professions.\
\
\'93Harold had been brought up as an idle young man about town, and on\
him the sudden change of fortune fell most heavily. He was undecided\
what to do in the future, but, in the meanwhile, partly from a spirit\
of independence, and partly from a desire to keep a home for his\
younger brothers, he took and furnished a small flat, which, it is\
interesting to note, is just off Exhibition Road, not far from the\
Natural History Museum in Kensington.\
\
\'93This was less than a year ago. Ten months later the newly-found heir\
to the peerage of Tremarn was found murdered in a hansom cab, and\
Harold Le Cheminant is once more the future Earl.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93The papers, as you know, talked of nothing else but the mysterious\
murder in the hansom cab. Every one\'92s sympathy went out at once to\
Lord Tremarn, who, on hearing the terrible news, had completely broken\
down, and was now lying on a bed of sickness, from which they say he\
may never recover.\
\
\'93From the first there had been many rumours of the terrible enmity\
which existed between Harold Le Cheminant and the man who had so\
easily captured Lord Tremarn\'92s heart, as well as the foremost place in\
the Grosvenor Square household.\
\
\'93The servants in the great and gloomy mansion told the detectives in\
charge of the case many stories of terrible rows which occurred at\
first between the cousins. And now every one\'92s eyes were already\
turned with suspicion on the one man who could most benefit by the\
death of Philip Le Cheminant.\
\
\'93However careful and reticent the police may be, details in connection\
with so interesting a case have a wonderful way of leaking out.\
Already one other most important fact had found its way into the\
papers. It appears that in their endeavours to reconstruct the last\
day spent by the murdered man the detectives had come upon most\
important evidence.\
\
\'93It was Thomas Sawyer, hall porter of the Junior Grosvenor Club, who\
first told the following interesting story. He stated that deceased\
was a member of the club, and had dined there on the evening preceding\
his death.\
\
\'93\'91Mr. Le Cheminant was just coming downstairs after his dinner,\'92\
explained Thomas Sawyer to the detectives, \'91when a stranger comes into\
the hall of the club; Mr. Le Cheminant saw him as soon as I did, and\
appeared very astonished. \'93What do you want?\'94 he says rather sharply.\
\'93A word with you,\'94 replies the stranger. Mr. Le Cheminant seemed to\
hesitate for a moment. He lights a cigar, whilst the stranger stands\
there glaring at him with a look in his eye I certainly didn\'92t like.\
\
\'93\'91Mind you,\'92 added Thomas Sawyer, \'91the stranger was a gentleman, in\
evening dress, and all that. Presently Mr. Le Cheminant says to him:\
\'93This way, then,\'94 and takes him along into one of the club rooms. Half\
an hour later the stranger comes out again. He looked flushed and\
excited. Soon after Mr. Le Cheminant comes out too; but he was quite\
calm and smoking a cigar. He asks for a cab, and tells the driver to\
take him to the Lyric Theatre.\'92\
\
\'93This was all that the hall-porter had to say, but his evidence was\
corroborated by one of the waiters of the club who saw Mr. Le\
Cheminant and the stranger subsequently enter the dining-room, which\
was quite deserted at the time.\
\
\'93\'91They \'92adn\'92t been in the room a minute,\'92 said the waiter, \'91when I\
\'92eard loud voices, as if they was quarrelling frightful. I couldn\'92t\
\'92ear what they said, though I tried, but they were shouting so, and\
drowning each other\'92s voices. Presently there\'92s a ring at my bell, and\
I goes into the room. Mr. Le Cheminant was sitting beside one of the\
tables, quietly lighting a cigar. \'93Show this\'97er\'97gentleman out of the\
club,\'94 \'92e says to me. The stranger looked as if \'92e would strike \'92im.\
\'93You\'92ll pay for this,\'94 \'92e says, then \'92e picks up \'92is \'92at, and dashes\
out of the club helter-skelter. \'93One is always pestered by these\
beggars,\'94 says Mr. Le Cheminant to me, as \'92e stalks out of the room.\'92\
\
\'93Later on it was arranged that both Thomas Sawyer and the waiter\
should catch sight of Harold Le Cheminant, as he went out of his house\
in Exhibition Road. Neither of them had the slightest hesitation in\
recognising in him the stranger who had called at the club that night.\
\
\'93Now that they held this definite clue, the detectives continued their\
work with a will. They made enquiries at the Lyric Theatre, but there\
they only obtained very vague testimony; one point, however, was of\
great value, the commissionaire outside one of the neighbouring\
theatres stated that, some time after the performance had begun he\
noticed a gentleman in evening dress walking rapidly past him.\
\
\'93He seemed strangely excited, for as he went by he muttered quite\
audibly to himself; \'91I can stand it no longer, it must be he or I.\'92\
Then he disappeared in the fog, walking away towards Shaftesbury\
Avenue. Unfortunately the commissionaire, just like the cabman, was\
not prepared to swear to the identity of this man, whom he had only\
seen momentarily through the fog.\
\
\'93But add to all this testimony the very strong motive there was for\
the crime, and you will not wonder that within twenty-four hours of\
the murder, the strongest suspicions had already fastened on Harold Le\
Cheminant, and it was generally understood that, even before the\
inquest, the police already had in readiness a warrant for his arrest\
on the capital charge.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93It would be difficult, I think, for any one who was not present at\
that memorable inquest to have the least idea of the sensation which\
its varied and dramatic incidents caused among the crowd of spectators\
there.\
\
\'93At first the proceedings were of the usual kind. The medical officer\
gave his testimony as to the cause of death; for this was, of course,\
not in dispute. The stiletto was produced; it was of an antique and\
foreign pattern, probably of Eastern or else Spanish origin. In\
England, it could only have been purchased at some _bric-\'e0-brac_ shop.\
\
\'93Then it was the turn of the servants at Grosvenor Square, of the\
cabman, and of the commissionaire. Lord Tremarn\'92s evidence, which he\
had sworn to on his sickbed, was also read. It added nothing to the\
known facts of the case, for he had last seen his favourite nephew\
alive in the course of the afternoon preceding the latter\'92s tragic\
end.\
\
\'93After that the _employ\'e9s_ of the Junior Grosvenor Club retold their\
story, and they were the first to strike the note of sensation which\
was afterwards raised to its highest possible pitch.\
\
\'93Both of them, namely, were asked each in their turn to look round the\
court and see if they could recognise the stranger who had called at\
the club that memorable evening. Without the slightest hesitation,\
both the hall-porter and the waiter pointed to Harold Le Cheminant,\
who sat with his solicitor in the body of the court.\
\
\'93But already an inkling of what was to come had gradually spread\
through that crowded court\'97instinctively every one felt that behind\
the apparent simplicity of this tragic case there lurked another\
mystery more strange even than that murder in the hansom cab.\
\
\'93Evidence was being taken as to the previous history of the deceased,\
his first appearance in London, his relationship with his uncle, and\
subsequently his enmity with his cousin Harold. At this point a man\
was brought forward as a witness, who it was understood had\
communicated with the police at the very last moment, offering to make\
a statement which he thought would throw considerable light upon the\
mysterious affair.\
\
\'93He was a man of about fifty years of age, who looked like a very\
seedy, superannuated clerk of some insurance office.\
\
\'93He gave his name as Charles Collins, and said that he resided in\
Caxton Road, Clapham.\
\
\'93In a perfectly level tone of voice, he then explained that some three\
years ago, his son William, who had always been idle and\
good-for-nothing, had suddenly disappeared from home.\
\
\'93\'91We heard nothing of him for over two years,\'92 continued Charles\
Collins, in that same cheerless and even voice which spoke of a\
monotonous existence of ceaseless, patient grind, \'91but some few weeks\
ago my daughter went up to the West End to see about an engagement\'97she\
plays dance music at parties sometimes\'97when, in Regent Street, she\
came face to face with her brother William. He was no longer wretched,\
as we all are,\'92 added the old man pathetically, \'91he was dressed like a\
swell, and when his sister spoke to him, he pretended not to know her.\
But she\'92s a sharp girl, and guessed at once that there was something\
strange there which William wished to hide. She followed him from a\
distance, and never lost sight of him that day, until she saw him\
about six o\'92clock in the evening go into one of the fine houses in\
Grosvenor Square. Then she came home and told her mother and me all\
about it.\'92\
\
\'93I can assure you,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93that you might\
have heard a pin drop in that crowded court whilst the old man spoke.\
That he was stating the truth no one doubted for a moment. The very\
fact that he was brought forward as a witness showed that his story\
had been proved, at any rate, to the satisfaction of the police.\
\
\'93The Collinses seem to have been very simple, good-natured people. It\
never struck any of them to interfere with William, who appeared, in\
their own words, to have \'91bettered himself.\'92 They concluded that he\
had obtained some sort of position in a rich family, and was now\
ashamed of his poor relations at Clapham.\
\
\'93Then one morning they read in the papers the story of the mysterious\
murder in the hansom cab, together with a description of the victim,\
who had not yet been identified. \'91William,\'92 they said with one accord.\
Michael Collins, one of the younger sons, went up to London to view\
the murdered man at the mortuary. There was no doubt whatever that it\
was William, and yet all the papers persisted in saying that the\
deceased was the heir to some grand peerage.\
\
\'93\'91So I wrote to the police,\'92 concluded Charles Collins, \'91and my wife\
and children were all allowed to view the body, and we are all\
prepared to swear that it is that of my son, William Collins, who was\
no more heir to a peerage than your worship.\'92\
\
\'93And mopping his forehead, with a large coloured handkerchief, the old\
man stepped down from the box.\
\
\'93Well, you may imagine what this bombshell was in the midst of that\
coroner\'92s court. Everyone looked at his neighbour wondering if this\
was real life, or some romantic play being acted on a stage. Amidst\
indescribable excitement, various other members of the Collins\'92 family\
corroborated the old man\'92s testimony, as did also one or two friends\
from Clapham. All those who had been allowed to view the body of the\
murdered man pronounced it without hesitation to be that of William\
Collins, who had disappeared from home three years ago.\
\
\'93You see, it was like a repetition of the Tichborne case, only with\
this strange difference: This claimant was dead, but all his papers\
were in perfect order, the certificate of marriage between Lucie\
Legrand and Arthur Le Cheminant at Martinique, as well as the birth\
and baptismal certificate of Philip Le Cheminant, their son. Yet there\
were all those simple, honest folk swearing that the deceased had been\
born in Clapham, and the mother, surely, could not have been mistaken.\
\
\'93That is where the difference with the other noteworthy case came in,\
for in this instance as far as the general public is concerned the\
actual identity of the murdered man will always remain a matter of\
doubt\'97Philip Le Cheminant or William Collins took that part of his\
secret, at any rate, with him to his grave.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter V\
\
\'93But the murder?\'94 I asked eagerly, for the man in the corner had\
paused, intent upon the manufacture of innumerable knots in a long\
piece of string.\
\
\'93Ah, yes, the murder, of course,\'94 he replied with a chuckle, \'93the\
second mystery in this extraordinary case. Well, of course, whatever\
the identity of the deceased really was, there was no doubt in the\
minds of the police that Harold Le Cheminant had murdered him. To him,\
at any rate, the Collins family were unknown; he only knew the man who\
had supplanted him in his uncle\'92s affections, and snatched a rich\
inheritance away from him. The charge brought against him at the\
Westminster Court was also one of the greatest sensations of this\
truly remarkable case.\
\
\'93It looked, indeed, as if the unfortunate young man had committed a\
crime which was as appalling as it was useless. Instead of murdering\
the impostor\'97if impostor he was\'97how much more simple it would have\
been to have tried to unmask him. But, strange to say, this he never\
seems to have done, at any rate as far as the public knew.\
\
\'93But here again mystery stepped in. When brought before the\
magistrate, Harold Le Cheminant was able to refute the terrible charge\
brought against him by the simple means of a complete _alibi_. After\
the stormy episode at the Junior Grosvenor Club he had gone to his own\
club in Pall Mall, and fortunately for him, did not leave it until\
twenty minutes past eleven, some few minutes _after_ the two men in\
evening dress got into the hansom in Shaftesbury Avenue.\
\
\'93But for this lucky fact, for which he had one or two witnesses, it\
might have fared ill with him, for feeling unduly excited, he walked\
all the way home afterwards; and had he left his club earlier, he\
might have found it difficult to account for his time. As it was, he\
was, of course, discharged.\
\
\'93But one more strange fact came out during the course of the\
magisterial investigation, and that was that Harold Le Cheminant, on\
the very day preceding the murder, had booked a passage for St.\
Vincent. He admitted in court that he meant to conduct certain\
investigations there, with regard to the identity of the supposed heir\
to the Tremarn peerage.\
\
\'93And thus the curtain came down on the last act of that extraordinary\
drama, leaving two great mysteries unsolved: the real identity of the\
murdered man, and that of the man who killed him. Some people still\
persist in thinking it was Harold Le Cheminant. Well, we may easily\
dismiss _that_ supposition. Harold had decided to investigate the\
matter for himself; he was on his way to St. Vincent.\
\
\'93Surely common-sense would assert that, having gone so far, he would\
assure himself first, whether the man was an impostor or not, before\
he resorted to crime, in order to rid himself of him. Moreover, the\
witnesses who saw him leave his own club at twenty minutes past eleven\
were quite independent and very emphatic.\
\
\'93Another theory is that the Collins\'92 gang tried to blackmail Philip Le\
Cheminant or William Collins whichever we like to call him\'97and that it\
was one of them who murdered him out of spite, when he refused to\
submit to the blackmailing process.\
\
\'93Against that theory, however, there are two unanswerable\
arguments\'97firstly, the weapon used, which certainly was not one that\
would commend itself to the average British middle-class man on murder\
intent\'97a razor or knife would be more in his line; secondly, there is\
no doubt whatever that the murderer wore evening dress and an opera\
hat, a costume not likely to have been worn by any member of the\
Collins\'92 family, or their friends. We may, therefore, dismiss that\
theory also with equal certainty.\'94\
\
And he surveyed placidly the row of fine knots in his bit of string.\
\
\'93But then, according to you, who was the man in evening dress, and who\
but Harold Le Cheminant had any interest in getting rid of the\
claimant?\'94 I asked at last.\
\
\'93Who, indeed?\'94 he replied with a chuckle \'93who but the man who was as\
wax in the hands of that impostor.\'94\
\
\'93Whom do you mean?\'94 I gasped.\
\
\'93Let us take things from the beginning,\'94 he said, with ever-growing\
excitement, \'93and take the one thing which is absolutely beyond\
dispute, and that is the authenticity of the _papers_\'97the marriage\
certificate of Lucie Legrand, etc.\'97as against the authenticity of the\
_man_. Let us admit that the real Philip Le Cheminant was a refugee at\
St. Vincent, that he found out about his parentage and determined to\
go to England. He writes to his uncle, then sails for Europe, lands at\
Havre, and arrives in Paris.\'94\
\
\'93Why, Paris?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Because you, like the police and like the public, have persistently\
shut your eyes to an event which, to my mind has bearing upon the\
whole of this mysterious case, and that is the original murder\
committed in Paris a year ago, also in a cab, also with a\
stiletto\'97which that time was _not_ found\'97in fact, in the self-same\
manner as this murder a week ago.\
\
\'93Well, that crime was never brought home to its perpetrator any more\
than this one will be. But my contention is, that the man who\
committed that murder a year ago, repeated this crime last week\'97that\
the man who was murdered in Paris was the real Philip Le Cheminant,\
whilst the man who was murdered in London was some friend to whom he\
had confided his story, and probably his papers, and who then hit upon\
the bold plan of assuming the personality of the Martinique creole,\
heir to an English peerage.\'94\
\
\'93But what in the world makes you imagine such a preposterous thing?\'94 I\
gasped.\
\
\'93One tiny unanswerable fact,\'94 he replied quietly. \'93William Collins,\
the impostor, when he came to London, called upon a solicitor, and\
deposited with him the valuable papers, _after that_ he obtained his\
interview with Lord Tremarn. Then mark what happens. Without any\
question, immediately after that interview, and, therefore, without\
even having seen the papers of identification, Lord Tremarn accepts\
the claimant as his newly-found nephew.\
\
\'93And why?\
\
\'93Only because that claimant has a tremendous hold over the Earl, which\
makes the old man as wax in his hands, and it is only logical to\
conclude that that hold was none other than that Lord Tremarn had met\
his real nephew in Paris, and had killed him, sooner than to see him\
supplant his beloved heir, Harold.\
\
\'93I followed up the subsequent history of that Paris crime, and found\
that the Paris police had never established the identity of the\
murdered man. Being a stranger, and moneyless, he had apparently\
lodged in one of those innumerable ill-famed little hotels that abound\
in Paris, the proprietors of which have very good cause to shun the\
police, and therefore would not even venture so far as to go and\
identify the body when it lay in the Morgue.\
\
\'93But William Collins knew who the murdered man was; no doubt he lodged\
at the same hotel, and could lay his hands on the all-important\
papers. I imagine that the two young men originally met in St.\
Vincent, or perhaps on board ship. He assumed the personality of the\
deceased, crossed over to England, and confronted Lord Tremarn with\
the threat to bring the murder home to him if he ventured to dispute\
his claim.\
\
\'93Think of it all, and you will see that I am right. When Lord Tremarn\
first heard from his brother Arthur\'92s son, he went to Paris in order\
to assure himself of the validity of his claim. Seeing that there was\
no doubt of that, he assumed a friendly attitude towards the young\
man, and one evening took him out for a drive in a cab and murdered\
him on the way.\
\
\'93Then came Nemesis in the shape of William Collins, whom he dared not\
denounce, lest his crime be brought home to him. How could he come\
forward and say: \'91I know that this man is an impostor, as I happened\
to have murdered my nephew myself\'92?\
\
\'93No; he preferred to temporise, and bide his time until, perhaps,\
chance would give him his opportunity. It took a year in coming. The\
yoke had become too heavy. \'91It must be he or I!\'92 he said to himself\
that very night. Apparently he was on the best of terms with his\
tormentor, but in his heart of hearts he had always meant to be even\
with him at the last.\
\
\'93Everything favoured him; the foggy night, even the dispute between\
Harold and the impostor at the club. Can you not picture him meeting\
William Collins outside the theatre, hearing from him the story of the\
quarrel, and then saying, \'91Come with me to Harold\'92s; I\'92ll soon make\
the young jackanapes apologise to you\'92?\
\
\'93Mind you, a year had passed by since the original crime. William\
Collins, no doubt, never thought he had anything to fear from the old\
man. He got into the cab with him, and thus this remarkable story has\
closed, and Harold Le Cheminant is once more heir to the Earldom of\
Tremarn.\
\
\'93Think it all over, and bear in mind that Lord Tremarn _never_ made\
the slightest attempt to prove the rights or wrongs of the impostor\'92s\
claim. On this base your own conclusions, and then see if they do not\
inevitably lead you to admit mine as the only possible solution of\
this double mystery.\'94\
\
He was gone, leaving me bewildered and amazed, staring at my _Daily\
Telegraph_, where, side by side with a long recapitulation of the\
mysterious claimant of the Earldom there was the following brief\
announcement:\
\
\'93We regret to say that the condition of Lord Tremarn is decidedly\
worse to-day, and that but little hope is entertained of his recovery.\
Mr. Harold Le Cheminant has been his uncle\'92s constant and devoted\
companion during the noble Earl\'92s illness.\'94\
\
\
\
VIII. The Fate of the _Artemis_\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93Well, I\'92m \'97\'97!\'94 was my inelegant mental comment upon the news in that\
morning\'92s paper.\
\
\'93So are most people,\'94 rejoined the man in the corner, with that eerie\
way he had of reading my thoughts. \'93The _Artemis_ has come home,\
having safely delivered her dangerous cargo, and Captain Jutland\'92s\
explanations only serve to deepen the mystery.\'94\
\
\'93Then you admit there is one in this case?\'94 I said.\
\
\'93Only to the public. Not to me. But I do admit that the puzzle is a\
hard one. Do you remember the earlier details of the case? It was\
towards the end of 1903. Negotiations between Russia and Japan were\
just reaching a point of uncomfortable tension, and the man in the\
street guessed that war in the Far East was imminent.\
\
\'93Messrs. Mills and Co. had just completed an order for a number of\
their celebrated quick-firing guns for the Russian Government, and\
these\'97according to the terms of the contract\'97were to be delivered at\
Port Arthur on or about 1st February, 1904. Effectively, then, on 1st\
December last, the _Artemis_, under the command of Captain Jutland,\
sailed from Goole, with her valuable cargo on board, and with orders\
to proceed along as fast as possible, in view of the probable outbreak\
of hostilities.\
\
\'93Less than two hours after she had started, Messrs. Mills received\
intimation from the highest official quarters, that in all probability\
before the _Artemis_ could reach Port Arthur, and in view of coming\
eventualities, the submarine mines would have been laid at the\
entrance to the harbour. A secret plan of the port was therefore sent\
to the firm for Captain Jutland\'92s use, showing the only way through\
which he could possibly hope to navigate the _Artemis_ safely into the\
harbour, and without which she would inevitably come in contact with\
one of those terrible engines of wholesale destruction, which have\
since worked such awful havoc in this war.\
\
\'93But _there_ was the trouble. This official intimation, together with\
the plan, reached Messrs. Mills just two hours too late; it is a way\
peculiar to many official intimations. Fortunately, however, the\
_Artemis_ was to touch at Portsmouth on private business of the\
firm\'92s, and, therefore, it only meant finding a trustworthy messenger\
to meet Captain Jutland there, and to hand him over that all-important\
plan.\
\
\'93Of course, there was no time to be lost, but, above all, some one of\
extreme trustworthiness must be found for so important a mission. You\
must remember that the great European Power in question is beset by\
many foes in the shape of her own disaffected children, who desire her\
downfall even more keenly than does her Asiatic opponent. Also in\
times like these, when every method is fair which gives one adversary\
an advantage over the other, we must remember that our plucky little\
allies of the Far East are past masters in that art which is politely\
known as secret intelligence.\
\
\'93All this, you see, made it an absolute necessity to keep the mission\
to Captain Jutland a profound secret. I need not impress upon you the\
fact, I think, that it is not expedient for the plans of an important\
harbour to fall under prying eyes.\
\
\'93Finally, the choice fell on Captain Markham, R.N.R., lately of the\
mercantile marine, and at the time in the employ of our own Secret\
Intelligence Department, to which he has rendered frequent and\
valuable services. This choice was determined also mainly through the\
fact that Captain Markham\'92s wife had relatives living in Portsmouth,\
and that, therefore, his journey thither could easily be supposed to\
have an unofficial and quite ordinary character\'97especially if he took\
his wife with him, which he did.\
\
\'93Captain and Mrs. Markham left Waterloo for Portsmouth at ten minutes\
past twelve on Wednesday, 2nd December, the secret plan lying safely\
concealed at the bottom of Mrs. Markham\'92s jewel-case.\
\
\'93As the _Artemis_ would not touch at Portsmouth until the following\
morning, Captain Markham thought it best not to spend the night at an\
hotel, but to go into rooms; his choice fell on a place, highly\
recommended by his wife\'92s relations, and which was situated in a quiet\
street on the Southsea side of the town. There he and his wife stayed\
the night, pending the arrival of the _Artemis_.\
\
\'93But at twelve o\'92clock on the following morning the police were\
hastily called in by Mrs. Bowden, the landlady of 49, Gastle Street,\
where the Markhams had been staying. Captain Markham had been found\
lying half-insensible, gagged and bound, on the floor of the\
sitting-room, his hands and feet tightly pinioned, and a woollen\
comforter wound closely round his mouth and neck; whilst Mrs.\
Markham\'92s jewel-case, containing valuable jewellery and the secret\
plans of Port Arthur, had disappeared.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93Mind you,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after he had assured\
himself of my undivided attention, \'93all these details were unknown to\
the public at first. I have merely co-ordinated them, and told them to\
you in the actual sequence in which they occurred, so that you may be\
able to understand the subsequent events.\
\
\'93At the time\'97that is to say, on 3rd December, 1903\'97the evening papers\
only contained an account of what was then called \'91the mysterious\
outrage at Gastle Street, Portsmouth.\'92 A private gentleman was\
presumably assaulted and robbed in broad daylight, and inside a highly\
respectable house in a busy part of the city.\
\
\'93Mrs. Bowden, the landlady, was, as you may imagine, most excited and\
indignant. Her house and herself had been grossly insulted by this\
abominable outrage, and she did her level best to throw what light she\
could on this mysterious occurrence.\
\
\'93The story she told the police was indeed extraordinary, and as she\
repeated it to all her friends, and subsequently to one or two\
journalists, it roused public excitement to its highest pitch.\
\
\'93What she related at great length to the detective in charge of the\
case, was briefly this:\
\
\'93Captain and Mrs. Markham, it appears, arrived at 49, Gastle Street,\
on Wednesday afternoon, 2nd December, and Mrs. Bowden accommodated\
them with a sitting-room and bedroom, both on the ground floor. In the\
evening Mrs. Markham went out to dine with her brother, a Mr. Paulton,\
who is a well-known Portsmouth resident, but Captain Markham stayed in\
and had dinner alone in his sitting-room.\
\
\'93According to Mrs. Bowden\'92s version of the story, at about nine\
o\'92clock a stranger called to see Captain Markham. This stranger was\
obviously a foreigner, for he spoke broken English. Unfortunately, the\
hall at 49, Gastle Street, was very dark, and, moreover, the foreigner\
was attired in a magnificent fur coat, the collar of which hid the\
lower part of his face. All Mrs. Bowden could see of him was that he\
was very tall, and wore gold-rimmed spectacles.\
\
\'93\'91He was so very peremptory in his manner,\'92 continued Mrs. Bowden,\
\'91that I had to show him in at once. The Captain seemed surprised to\
see him\'97in fact, he looked decidedly annoyed, I might say; but just as\
I was closing the door I heard the stranger laugh, and say quite\
pleasantly: \'93You gave me the slip, my friend, but you see I have found\
you out all right.\'94\'92\
\
\'93Mrs. Bowden, after the manner of her class, seems to have made\
vigorous efforts to hear what went on in the sitting-room after that,\'94\
continued the man in the corner, \'93but she was not successful. Later\
on, however, the Captain rang and ordered whiskies and sodas. Both\
gentlemen were then sitting by the fire, looking quite friendly.\
\
\'93\'91I took a look round the room,\'92 explained the worthy landlady, \'91and\
took particular notice that the jewel-case was on the table, with the\
lid open. Captain Markham, as soon he saw me, closed it very quickly.\'92\
\
\'93The stranger seems to have gone away at about half-past ten, and\
subsequently again Mrs. Markham came home accompanied by her brother,\
Mr. Paulton. The next morning she went out at a quarter past eleven\
o\'92clock, and about half an hour later the mysterious stranger called\
again.\
\
\'93This time he pushed his way straight into the sitting-room; but the\
very next moment he uttered a cry of intense horror and astonishment,\
and rushed back into the hall, gesticulating wildly, and shrieking: \'91A\
robbery!\'97a murder!\'97I go for the police!\'92 And before Mrs. Bowden could\
stop him, or even could realise what had occurred, he had dashed out\
of the house.\
\
\'93\'91I called to Meggie,\'92 continued Mrs. Bowden, \'91I was so frightened, I\
didn\'92t dare go into the parlour alone. But she was more frightened\
than I was, and we stood trembling in the hall waiting for the police.\
At last I began to have my suspicions, and I got Meggie to run out\
into the street and see if she could bring in a policeman.\'92\
\
\'93When the police at last arrived upon the scene, they pushed open the\
sitting-room door, and there found Captain Markham in a most helpless\
condition, his hands tied behind his back, and himself half-choked by\
the scarf over his mouth. As soon as he recovered his breath, he\
explained that he had no idea who his assailant was; he was standing\
with his back to the door, when he was suddenly dealt a blow on the\
head from behind, and he remembered nothing more.\
\
\'93In the meantime Mrs. Markham had come home, and of course was\
horrified beyond measure at the outrage which had been committed. She\
declared that her jewel-case was in the sitting-room when she went out\
in the morning\'97a fact confirmed by Captain Markham himself.\
\
\'93But here, at once, the police were seriously puzzled. Mrs. Bowden, of\
course, told her story of the foreigner\'97a story which was corroborated\
by her daughter, Meggie. Captain Markham, pressed by the police, and\
by his wife, admitted that a friend had visited him the evening\
before.\
\
\'93\'91He is an old friend I met years ago abroad, who happened to be in\
Portsmouth yesterday, and quite accidentally caught sight of me as I\
drove up to this door, and naturally came in to see me,\'92 was the\
Captain\'92s somewhat lame explanation.\
\
\'93Nothing more was to be got out of him that day; he was still feeling\
very bewildered he said, and certainly he looked very ill. Mrs.\
Markham then put the whole matter in the hands of the police.\
\
\'93Captain Markham had given a description of \'91the old friend he had met\
years ago abroad.\'92 This description vaguely coincided with that given\
by Mrs. Bowden of the mysterious foreigner. But the Captain\'92s replies\
to the cross-questionings of the detectives in charge of the case were\
always singularly reticent and lame. \'91I had lost sight of him for\
nearly twenty years,\'92 he explained, \'91and do not know what his present\
abode and occupation might be. When I knew him years ago, he was a man\
of independent means, without a fixed abode, and a great traveller. I\
believe that he is a German by nationality, but I don\'92t think that I\
ever knew this as a fact. His name was Johann Schmidt.\'92\
\
\'93I may as well tell you here, at once, that the mysterious foreigner\
managed to make good his escape. He was traced as far as the South\
Western Railway Station, where he was seen to rush through the\
barrier, just in time to catch the express up to town. At Waterloo he\
was lost sight of in the crowd.\
\
\'93The police were keenly on the alert; no trace of the missing jewels\
had as yet been found. Then it was that, gradually, the story of the\
secret plan of Port Arthur reached the ears of the general public. Who\
first told it, and to whom, it is difficult to conjecture, but you\
know what a way things of that sort have of leaking out.\
\
\'93The secret of Captain Markham\'92s mission had of necessity been known\
to several people, and a secret shared by many soon ceases to be one\
at all; anyway, within a week of the so-called \'91Portsmouth outrage,\'92\
it began to be loudly whispered that the robbery of Mrs. Markham\'92s\
jewels was only a mask that covered the deliberate theft of the plans\
of Port Arthur.\
\
\'93And then the inevitable happened. Already Captain Markham\'92s strange\
attitude had been severely commented upon, and now the public, backed\
by the crowd of amateur detectives who read penny novelettes and form\
conclusions of their own, had made up its mind that Captain Markham\
was a party to the theft\'97that he was either the tool or the accomplice\
of the mysterious foreigner and that, in fact, he had been either\
bribed or terrorised into giving up the plan of Port Arthur to an\
enemy of the Russian government. The crime was all the more heinous as\
by this act of treachery a British ship, manned by a British crew, had\
been sent to certain destruction.\
\
\'93What rendered the whole case doubly mysterious was that Messrs. Mills\
and Co. seemed to take the matter with complete indifference. They\
refused to be interviewed, or to give any information about the\
_Artemis_ at all, and seemed callously willing to await events.\
\
\'93The public was furious; the newspapers stormed; every one felt that\
the _Artemis_ should be stopped at any cost at her next port of call,\
and not allowed to continue her perilous journey.\
\
\'93And yet the days went by; the public read with horror at Lloyds\'92 that\
the _Artemis_ had called at Malta, at Port Said, at Aden, and was now\
well on her way to the Far East. Feeling ran so high throughout\
England, that, if the mysterious stranger had been discovered by the\
police, no protection from them would have saved him from being\
lynched.\
\
\'93As for Captain Markham, public opinion reserved its final judgment. A\
cloud hung over him, of that there was no doubt; many said openly that\
he had sold the secret plans of Port Arthur, either to the Japanese or\
to the Nihilists, either through fear or intimidation, if not through\
greed.\
\
\'93Then the inevitable climax came: A certain Mr. Carleton constituted\
himself the spokesman of the general public; he met Captain Markham\
one day at one of the clubs in London. There were hot words between\
them. Mr. Carleton did not mince matters; he openly accused Captain\
Markham of that which public opinion had already whispered, and\
finally, completely losing his temper, he struck the Captain in the\
face, calling him every opprobrious name he could think of.\
\
\'93But for the timely interference of friends, there would have been\
murder committed then and there; as it was, Captain Markham was\
induced by his own friends to bring a criminal charge of slander and\
of assault against Mr. Carleton, as the only means of making the whole\
story public, and possibly vindicating his character.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93A criminal action for slander and assault is always an interesting\
one,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after a while, \'93as it always\
argues an unusual amount of personal animosity on the part of the\
plaintiff.\
\
\'93In this case, of course, public interest was roused to its highest\
pitch. Practically, though Captain Markham was the prosecutor, he\
would stand before his fellow-citizens after this action either as an\
innocent man, or as one of the most dastardly scoundrels this nation\
has ever known.\
\
\'93The case for the Captain was briefly stated by his counsel. For the\
defence Sir Arthur Inglewood, on behalf of Mr. Carleton, pleaded\
justification. With wonderful eloquence Sir Arthur related the whole\
story of the secret plan of Port Arthur confided to the honour of\
Captain Markham, and which involved the safety of the British ship and\
the lives of a whole British crew.\
\
\'93The first witnesses called for the defence were Mrs. Bowden and her\
daughter, Meggie. Both related the story I have already told you. When\
they came to the point of having seen the jewel-case _open_ on the\
table during that interview between Captain Markham and the mysterious\
stranger, there was a regular murmur of indignation throughout the\
whole crowd, so much so, that the judge threatened to clear the court,\
for Sir Arthur argued this to be a proof that Captain Markham had been\
a willing accomplice in the theft of the secret plans, and had merely\
played the comedy of being assaulted, bound, and gagged.\
\
\'93But there was more to come.\
\
\'93It appears that on the morning of 2nd December\'97that is to say, before\
going to Portsmouth\'97Captain Markham, directly after breakfast, and\
while his wife was up in her own room, received a message which seemed\
greatly to disturb him. It was Jane Mason, the parlour-maid at the\
Markhams\'92 town house, who told the story.\
\
\'93A letter bearing no stamp had been dropped into the letter-box, she\
had taken it to her master, who, on reading it, became greatly\
agitated; he tore up the letter, stuffed it into his pocket and\
presently took up his hat and rushed out of the house.\
\
\'93\'91When the master was gone,\'92 continued Jane, \'91I found a scrap of\
paper, which had fallen out of his pocket.\'92\
\
\'93This scrap of paper Jane Mason had carefully put away. She was a\
shrewd girl, and scented some mystery. It was now produced in court,\
and the few fragmentary words were read out by Sir Arthur Inglewood,\
amidst boundless excitement:\
\
\'93\'91....if you lend a hand........Port Arthur safely.......hold my\
tongue....\'92\
\
\'93And at the end there were four letters in large capitals, \'91STOW.\'92\
\
\'93In view of all the evidence taken, there was momentous significance\
to be attached to those few words, of which only the last four letters\
seemed mysterious, but these probably were part of the confederate\'92s\
signature, who had\'97no one doubted it now\'97some hold upon Captain\
Markham, and had by a process of blackmail induced him to send the\
_Artemis_ to her doom.\
\
\'93After that, according to a statement made by the head clerk of\
Messrs. Mills and Co., Captain Markham came round to the office\
begging that some one else should be sent to meet Captain Jutland at\
Portsmouth. \'91This,\'92 explained the head clerk, who had been subp\'9cnaed\
for the defence, \'91was quite impossible at this eleventh hour, and, in\
the absence of the heads of the firm, I had on Mr. Mills\'92 behalf to\
hold Captain Markham to his promise.\'92\
\
\'93This closed the case for the defence, and in view of the lateness of\
the hour, counsels\'92 speeches were reserved for the following day.\
There was not a doubt in anybody\'92s mind that Captain Markham was\
guilty, and but for the presence of a large body of police, I assure\
you he would have been torn to pieces by the crowd.\'94\
\
The man in the corner paused in his narrative and blinked at me over\
his bone-rimmed spectacles, like some lean and frowzy tom-cat, eager\
for a fight.\
\
\'93Well?\'94 I said eagerly.\
\
\'93Well, surely you remember what happened the following day?\'94 he\
replied, with a dry chuckle. \'93Personally, I don\'92t think that there\
ever was quite so much sensation in any English court of law.\
\
\'93It was crowded, of course, when counsel for the plaintiff rose to\
speak. He made, however, only a short statement, briefly and to the\
point; but this statement caused every one to look at his neighbour,\
wondering if he were awake or dreaming.\
\
\'93Counsel began by saying that Messrs. Mills and Co., in view of the\
obvious conspiracy that had existed against the _Artemis_, had\
decided, in conjunction with Captain Markham himself, to say nothing\
about the safety of the ship until she was in port; but now counsel\
had much pleasure in informing the court and public that the _Artemis_\
had safely arrived at Port Arthur, had landed her guns, and was on her\
way home again by now. A cablegram _via_ St. Petersburg had been\
received by Messrs. Mills and Co., from Captain Jutland that very\
morning.\
\
\'93That cablegram was read by counsel in court, and was received with\
loud and prolonged cheering which could not be suppressed.\
\
\'93With heroic fortitude\'97explained counsel\'97Captain Markham had borne the\
gross suspicions against his integrity, only hoping that news of the\
safety of the _Artemis_ would reach England in time to allow him to\
vindicate his character. But until Captain Jutland was safe in port,\
he had sworn to hold his tongue and to bear insult and violence,\
sooner than once more jeopardise the safety of the British ship by\
openly avowing that she carried the plans of the important port with\
her.\
\
\'93Well, you know the rest. The parties, at the suggestion of the judge,\
arranged the case amicably, and, Captain Markham being fully\
satisfied, Mr. Carleton was nominally ordered to come up for trial\
when called upon.\
\
\'93Captain Markham was the hero of the hour; but presently, after the\
first excitement had subsided, sensible people began to ponder. Every\
one, of course, appreciated the fact that Messrs. Mills and Co.,\
prompted by the highest authorities, had insisted on not jeopardising\
the safety of the _Artemis_ by shouting on the housetops that she was\
carrying the plans of Port Arthur on board. Hostilities in the Far\
East were on the point of breaking out, and I need not insist, I\
think, on the obvious fact that silence in such matters and at such a\
time was absolutely imperative.\
\
\'93But what sensible people wanted to know was, what part had Captain\
Markham played in all this?\
\
\'93In the evening of that memorable 2nd December, he was sitting\
amicably by the fire with the mysterious stranger, who was evidently\
blackmailing him, and with the jewel-case, which contained the plans\
of Port Arthur, open between them. What, then, had caused Captain\
Markham to change his attitude? What dispelled the fear of the\
stranger? Was he really assaulted? Was the jewel-case really stolen?\
\
\'93Captain Jutland, of the _Artemis_, has explained that he was only on\
shore for one hour at Portsmouth on the memorable morning of 3rd\
December, namely, between 10.30 and 11.30 a.m. On landing at the Hard\
from his gig, he was met by a gentleman, whom he did not know, and\
who, without a word of comment, handed him some papers, which proved\
to be plans of Port Arthur.\
\
\'93Now, at that very hour Captain Markham was lying helpless in his\
bedroom, and the question now is, who abstracted the plans from the\
jewel-case, and then mysteriously handed them to Captain Jutland? Why\
was it not done openly? Why?\'97why? and, above all, by whom?\'97\'97\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93Indeed, why?\'94 I retorted, for he had paused, and was peering at me\
through his bone-rimmed spectacles. \'93You must have a theory,\'94 I added,\
as I quietly handed him a beautiful bit of string across the table.\
\
\'93Of course, I have a theory,\'94 he replied placidly; \'93nay, more, the\
only explanation of those mysterious events. But for this I must refer\
you to the scrap of paper found by Jane Mason, and containing the four\
fragmentary sentences which have puzzled every one, and which Captain\
Markham always refused to explain.\
\
\'93Do you remember,\'94 he went on, as he began feverishly to construct\
knot upon knot on that piece of string, \'93the wreck of the _Ridstow_\
some twenty years ago? She was a pleasure boat belonging to Mr. Eyres,\
the great millionaire financier, and was supposed to have been wrecked\
in the South Seas, with nearly all hands. Five of her crew, however,\
were picked up by H.M.S. _Pomona_, on a bit of rocky island to which\
they had managed to swim.\
\
\'93I looked up the files of the newspapers relating to the rescue of\
these five shipwrecked mariners, who told a most pitiable tale of the\
loss of the yacht and their subsequent escape to, and sufferings on\
the island. Fire had broken out in the hull of the _Ridstow_, and all\
her crew were drowned, with the exception of three sailors, a Russian\
friend, or rather secretary, of Mr. Eyres, and a young petty officer\
named Markham.\
\
\'93You see, the letters stow had given me the clue. Clearly Markham, on\
receiving the message on the morning of 2nd December, was frightened,\
and when we analyse the fragments of that message and try to\
reconstruct the missing fragments, do we not get something like this:\
\
\'93\'91If _you lend a hand_ in allowing the _Artemis_ to reach _Port Arthur\
safely_, and to land her cargo there, I will no longer _hold my\
tongue_ about the events which occurred on board the _Ridstow_.\'92\
\
\'93Clearly the mysterious stranger had a great hold over Captain\
Markham, for every scrap of evidence, if you think it over, points to\
his having been _frightened_. Did he not beg the clerk to find some\
one else to meet Captain Jutland in Portsmouth? He did not wish _to\
lend a hand_ in allowing the _Artemis_ to reach _Port Arthur safely_.\
\
\'93We must, therefore, take it that on board the _Ridstow_ some such\
tragedy was enacted as, alas! is not of unfrequent occurrence. The\
tragedy of a mutiny, a wholesale murder, the robbery of the rich\
financier, the burning of the yacht. Markham, then barely twenty, was\
no doubt an unwilling, perhaps passive, accomplice; one can trace the\
hand of a cunning, daring Russian in the whole of this mysterious\
tragedy.\
\
\'93Since then, Markham, through twenty years\'92 faithful service of his\
country, had tried to redeem the passive crime of his early years. But\
then came the crisis: The cunning leader of that bygone tragedy no\
doubt kept a strong hand over his weaker accomplices.\
\
\'93What happened to the other three we do not know, but we have seen how\
terrified Markham is of him, how he dare not resist him, and when the\
mysterious Russian\'97some Nihilist, no doubt, at war with his own\
Government\'97wishes to deal his country a terrible blow by possessing\
himself of the plan of her most important harbour, so that he might\
sell it to her enemies, Markham dare not say him nay.\
\
\'93But mark what happens. Captain Markham terrorised, confronted with a\
past crime, threatened with exposure, is as wax in the hands of his\
unscrupulous tormentor. But beside him there is the saving presence of\
his wife.\'94\
\
\'93His wife?\'94 I gasped.\
\
\'93Yes, the woman! Did you think this was a crime without the inevitable\
woman! I sought her, and found her in Captain Markham\'92s wife. To save\
her husband both from falling a victim to his implacable accomplice,\
and from committing another even more heinous crime, she suggests the\
comedy which was so cleverly enacted in the morning of 3rd December.\
\
\'93When the landlady and her daughter saw the jewel-case open on the\
table the evening before, Markham was playing the first act of the\
comedy invented by his wife. She had the plan safely in her own\
keeping by then. He pretended to agree to the Russian\'92s demands, but\
showed him that he had not then the plan in his possession, promising,\
however, to deliver it up on the morrow.\
\
\'93Then in the morning, Mrs. Markham helps to gag and strap her husband\
down; he pretends to lie unconscious, and she goes out carrying the\
jewel-case. Her brother, Mr. Paulton, of course helps them both;\
without him it would have been more difficult; as it is, he takes\
charge of the jewel-case, abstracts the plan and papers, and finally\
meets Captain Jutland at the Hard, and hands him over the plan of Port\
Arthur.\
\
\'93Thus through the wits of a clever and devoted woman, not only are the\
_Artemis_ and her British crew saved, but Captain Markham is\
effectually rid of the blackmailer, who otherwise would have poisoned\
his life, and probably out of revenge at being foiled, have ruined his\
victim altogether.\
\
\'93To my mind, that was the neatest thing in the whole plan. The general\
public believed that Captain Markham (who obviously at the instigation\
of his wife had confided in Messrs. Mills and Co.) held his tongue as\
to the safety of the _Artemis_ merely out of heroism, in order not to\
run her into any further danger. Now, I maintain that this was the\
masterstroke of that clever woman\'92s plan.\
\
\'93By holding his tongue, by letting the public fear for the safety of\
the British crew and British ship, public feeling was stirred to such\
a pitch of excitement that the Russian now would never _dare_ show\
himself. Not only\'97by denouncing Captain Markham now\'97would he never be\
even listened to for a moment, but, if he came forward at all, if he\
even showed himself, he would stand before the British public\
self-convicted as the man who had tried through the criminal process\
of blackmail to terrorise an Englishman into sending a British ship\
and thirty British sailors to certain annihilation.\
\
\'93No; I think we may take it for granted that the Russian will not dare\
to show his face in England again.\'94\
\
And the funny creature was gone before I could say another word.\
\
\
\
IX. The Disappearance of Count Collini\
\
Chapter I\
\
He was very argumentative that morning; whatever I said he invariably\
contradicted flatly and at once, and we both had finally succeeded in\
losing our temper.\
\
The man in the corner was riding one of his favourite hobby-horses.\
\
\'93It is _impossible_ for any person to completely disappear in a\
civilised country,\'94 he said emphatically, \'93provided that person has\
either friends or enemies of means and substance, who are interested\
in finding his or her whereabouts.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible is a sweeping word,\'94 I rejoined.\
\
\'93None too big for the argument,\'94 he concluded, as he surveyed with\
evident pride and pleasure a gigantic and complicated knot which his\
bony fingers had just fashioned.\
\
\'93I think that, nevertheless, you should not use it,\'94 I said placidly.\
\'93It is not _impossible_, though it may be very difficult to disappear\
without leaving the slightest clue or trace behind you.\'94\
\
\'93Prove it,\'94 he said, with a snap of his thin lips.\
\
\'93I can, quite easily.\'94\
\
\'93Now I know what is going on in your mind,\'94 said the uncanny creature,\
\'93you are thinking of that case last autumn.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I was,\'94 I admitted. \'93And you cannot deny that Count Collini has\
disappeared as effectually as if the sea had swallowed him up\'97many\
people think it did.\'94\
\
\'93Many idiots, you mean,\'94 he rejoined dryly. \'93Yes, I knew you would\
quote that case. It certainly was a curious one; all the more so,\
perhaps, as there was no inquest, no sensational police court\
proceedings, nothing dramatic, in fact, save that strange and\
wonderful disappearance.\
\
\'93I don\'92t know if you call to mind the whole plot of that weird drama.\
There was Thomas Checkfield, a retired biscuit baker of Reading, who\
died leaving a comfortable fortune, mostly invested in freehold\
property, and amounting to about \'a380,000, to his only child, Alice.\
\
\'93At the time of her father\'92s death, Alice Checkfield was just\
eighteen, and at school in Switzerland, where she had spent most of\
her life. Old Checkfield had been a widower ever since the birth of\
his daughter, and seems to have led a very lonely and eccentric life;\
leaving the girl at school abroad for years, only going very\
occasionally to see her, and seemingly having but little affection for\
her.\
\
\'93The girl herself had not been home in England since she was eight\
years old, and even when old Checkfield was dying he would not allow\
the girl to be apprised of his impending death, and to be brought home\
to a house of loneliness and mourning.\
\
\'93\'91What\'92s the good of upsetting a young girl, not eighteen,\'92 he said to\
his friend, Mr. Turnour, \'91by letting her see all the sad paraphernalia\
of death? She hasn\'92t seen much of her old father anyway, and will soon\
get over her loss, with young company round her, to help her bear up.\'92\
\
\'93But though Thomas Checkfield cared little enough for his daughter,\
when he died he left his entire fortune to her, amounting altogether\
to \'a380,000; and he appointed his friend, Reginald Turnour, to be her\
trustee and guardian until her marriage or until she should attain her\
majority.\
\
\'93It was generally understood that the words \'91until her marriage\'92 were\
put in because it had all along been arranged that Alice should marry\
Hubert Turnour, Reginald\'92s younger brother.\
\
\'93Hubert was old Checkfield\'92s godson, and if the old man had any\
affection for anybody it certainly was for Hubert. The latter had been\
a great deal in his godfather\'92s house, when he and Alice were both\
small children, and had called each other \'91hubby\'92 and \'91wifey\'92 in play,\
when they were still in the nursery. Later on, whenever old Checkfield\
went abroad to see his daughter, he always took Hubert with him, and a\
boy and girl flirtation sprang up between the two young people; a\
flirtation which had old Checkfield\'92s complete approval, and no doubt\
he looked upon their marriage as a _fait accompli_, merely desiring\
the elder Mr. Turnour to administer the girl\'92s fortune until then.\
\
\'93Hubert Turnour, at the time of the subsequent tragedy, was a\
good-looking young fellow, and by profession what is vaguely known as\
a \'91commission agent.\'92 He lived in London, where he had an office in a\
huge block of buildings close to Cannon Street Station.\
\
\'93There is no doubt that at the time of old Checkfield\'92s death, Alice\
looked upon herself as the young man\'92s _fianc\'e9e_. When the girl\
reached her nineteenth year, it was at last decided that she should\
leave school and come to England. The question as to what should be\
done with her until her majority, or until she married Hubert, was a\
great puzzle to Mr. Turnour. He was a bachelor, who lived in\
comfortable furnished rooms in Reading, and he did not at all relish\
the idea of starting housekeeping for the sake of his young ward, whom\
he had not seen since she was out of the nursery, and whom he looked\
upon as an intolerable nuisance.\
\
\'93Fortunately for him this vexed question was most satisfactorily and\
unexpectedly settled by Alice herself. She wrote to her guardian, from\
Geneva, that a Mrs. Brackenbury, the mother of her dearest\
schoolfellow had asked her to come and live with them, at any rate for\
a time, as this would be a more becoming arrangement than that of a\
young girl sharing a bachelor\'92s establishment.\
\
\'93Mr. Turnour seems to have hesitated for some time: he was a\
conscientious sort of man, who took his duties of guardianship very\
seriously. What ultimately decided him, however, was that his brother\
Hubert added the weight of his eloquent letters of appeal to those of\
Alice herself. Hubert naturally was delighted at the idea of having\
his rich _fianc\'e9e_ under his eye in London, and after a good deal of\
correspondence, Mr. Turnour finally gave his consent, and Alice\
Checkfield duly arrived from Switzerland in order to make a prolonged\
stay in Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s house.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93All seems to have gone on happily and smoothly for a time in Mrs.\
Brackenbury\'92s pretty house in Kensington,\'94 continued the man in the\
corner. \'93Hubert Turnour was a constant visitor there, and the two\
young people seem to have had all the freedom of an engaged couple.\
\
\'93Alice Checkfield was in no sense of the word an attractive girl; she\
was not good-looking, and no effort on Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s part could\
succeed in making her look stylish. Still, Hubert Turnour seemed quite\
satisfied, and the girl herself ready enough at first to continue the\
boy and girl flirtation as of old.\
\
\'93Soon, however, as time went on, things began to change. Now that\
Alice had become mistress of a comfortable fortune, there were plenty\
of people ready to persuade her that a \'91commission agent,\'92 with but\
vague business prospects, was not half good enough for her, and that\
her \'a380,000 entitled her to more ambitious matrimonial hopes. Needless\
to say that in these counsels Mrs. Brackenbury was very much to the\
fore.\
\
\'93She lived in Kensington, and had social ambitions, foremost among\
which was to see her daughter\'92s bosom friend married to, at least, a\
baronet, if not a peer.\
\
\'93A young girl\'92s head is quickly turned. Within six months of her stay\
in London, Alice was giving Hubert Turnour the cold shoulder, and the\
young man had soon realised that she was trying to get out of her\
engagement.\
\
\'93Scarcely had Alice reached her twentieth birthday, than she gave her\
erstwhile _fianc\'e9_ his formal _cong\'e9_.\
\
\'93At first Hubert seems to have taken his discomfiture very much to\
heart. \'a380,000 were not likely to come his way again in a hurry.\
According to Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s servants, there were one or two\
violent scenes between him and Alice, until finally Mrs. Brackenbury\
herself was forced to ask the young man to discontinue his visits.\
\
\'93It was soon after that that Alice Checkfield first met Count Collini\
at one of the brilliant subscription dances given by the Italian\
colony in London, the winter before last. Mrs. Brackenbury was charmed\
with him, Alice Checkfield was enchanted! The Count, having danced\
with Alice half the evening, was allowed to pay his respects at the\
house in Kensington.\
\
\'93He seemed to be extremely well off, for he was staying at the\
Carlton, and, after one or two calls on Mrs. Brackenbury, he began\
taking the ladies to theatres and concerts, always presenting them\
with the choicest and most expensive flowers, and paying them various\
other equally costly attentions.\
\
\'93Mrs. and Miss Brackenbury welcomed the Count with open arms\
(figuratively speaking). Alice was shy, but apparently over head and\
ears in love at first sight.\
\
\'93At first Mrs. Brackenbury did her best to keep this new\
acquaintanceship a secret from Hubert Turnour. I suppose that the old\
matchmaker feared another unpleasant scene. But the inevitable soon\
happened. Hubert, contrite, perhaps still hopeful, called at the house\
one day, when the Count was there, and, according to the story\
subsequently told by Miss Brackenbury herself, there was a violent\
scene between him and Alice. As soon as the fascinating foreigner had\
gone, Hubert reproached his _fianc\'e9e_ for her fickleness in no\
measured language, and there was a good deal of evidence to prove that\
he then and there swore to be even with the man who had supplanted him\
in her affections. There was nothing to do then but for Mrs.\
Brackenbury to \'91burn her boats.\'92 She peremptorily ordered Hubert out\
of her house, and admitted that Count Collini was a suitor, favoured\
by herself, for the hand of Alice Checkfield.\
\
\'93You see, I am bound to give you all these details of the situation,\'94\
continued the man in the corner, with his bland smile, \'93so that you\
may better form a judgment as to the subsequent fate of Count Collini.\
From the description which Mrs. Brackenbury herself subsequently gave\
to the police, the Count was then in the prime of life; of a dark\
olive complexion, dark eyes, extremely black hair and moustache. He\
had a very slight limp, owing to an accident he had had in early\
youth, which made his walk and general carriage unusual and distinctly\
noticeable. His was certainly not a personality that could pass\
unperceived in a crowd.\
\
\'93Hubert Turnour, furious and heartsick, wrote letter after letter to\
his brother, to ask him to interfere on his behalf; this Mr. Turnour\
did, to the best of his ability, but he had to deal with an ambitious\
matchmaker and with a girl in love, and it is small wonder that he\
signally failed. Alice Checkfield by now had become deeply enamoured\
of her Count, his gallantries flattered her vanity, his title and the\
accounts he gave of his riches and his estates in Italy fascinated\
her, and she declared that she would marry him, either with or without\
her guardian\'92s consent, either at once, or as soon as she had attained\
her majority, and was mistress of herself and of her fortune.\
\
\'93Mr. Turnour did all he could to prevent this absurd marriage. Being a\
sensible, middle-class Britisher, he had no respect for foreign\
titles, and little belief in foreign wealth. He wrote the most urgent\
letters to Alice, warning her against a man whom he firmly believed to\
be an impostor; finally, he flatly refused to give his consent to the\
marriage.\
\
\'93Thus a few months went by. The Count had been away in Italy all\
through the winter and spring, and returned to London for the season,\
apparently more enamoured with the Reading biscuit baker\'92s daughter\
than ever. Alice Checkfield was then within nine months of her\
twenty-first birthday, and determined to marry the Count. She openly\
defied her guardian.\
\
\'93\'91Nothing,\'92 she wrote to him, \'91would ever induce me to marry Hubert.\'92\
\
\'93I suppose it was this which finally induced Mr. Turnour to give up\
all opposition to the marriage. Seeing that his brother\'92s chances were\
absolutely _nil_, and that Alice was within nine months of her\
majority, he no doubt thought all further argument useless, and with\
great reluctance finally gave his consent.\
\
\'93The marriage, owing to the difference of religion, was to be\
performed before a registrar, and was finally fixed to take place on\
22nd October, 1903, which was just a week after Alice\'92s twenty-first\
birthday.\
\
\'93Of course the question of Alice\'92s fortune immediately cropped up: she\
desired her money in cash, as her husband was taking her over to live\
in Italy, where she desired to make all further investments. She,\
therefore, asked Mr. Turnour to dispose of her freehold property for\
her. There again Mr. Turnour hesitated, and argued, but once he had\
given his consent to the marriage, all opposition was useless, more\
especially as Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s solicitors had drawn up a very\
satisfactory marriage settlement, which the Count himself had\
suggested, by which Alice was to retain sole use and control of her\
own private fortune.\
\
\'93The marriage was then duly performed before a registrar on that 22nd\
of October, and Alice Checkfield could henceforth style herself\
Countess Collini. The young couple were to start for Italy almost\
directly, but meant to spend a day or two at Dover quietly together.\
There were, however, one or two tiresome legal formalities to go\
through. Mr. Turnour had, by Alice\'92s desire, handed over the sum of\
\'a380,000 in notes to her solicitor, Mr. R. W. Stanford. Mr. Stanford\
had gone down to Reading two days before the marriage, had received\
the money from Mr. Turnour, and then called upon the new Countess, and\
formally handed her over her fortune in Bank of England notes.\
\
\'93Then it was necessary, in view of immediate and future arrangements,\
to change the English money into foreign, which the Count and his\
young wife did themselves that afternoon.\
\
\'93At 5 o\'92clock p.m. they started for Dover, accompanied by Mrs.\
Brackenbury, who desired to see the last of her young friend, prior to\
the latter\'92s departure for abroad. The Count had engaged a magnificent\
suite of rooms at the Lord Warden Hotel, and thither the party\
proceeded.\
\
\'93So far, you see,\'94 added the man in the corner, \'93the story is of the\
utmost simplicity. You might even call it commonplace. A foreign\
Count, an ambitious matchmaker, and a credulous girl; these form the\
ingredients of many a domestic drama, that culminates at the police\
courts. But at this point this particular drama becomes more\
complicated, and, if you remember, ends in one of the strangest\
mysteries that has ever baffled the detective forces on both sides of\
the Channel.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
The man in the corner paused in his narrative. I could see that he was\
coming to the palpitating part of the story, for his fingers fidgeted\
incessantly with that bit of string.\
\
\'93Hubert Turnour, as you may imagine,\'94 he continued after a while, \'93did\
not take his final discomfiture very quietly. He was a very\
violent-tempered young man, and it was certainly enough to make any\
one cross. According to Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s servants he used most\
threatening language in reference to Count Collini; and on one\
occasion was with difficulty prevented from personally assaulting the\
Count in the hall of Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s pretty Kensington house.\
\
\'93Count Collini finally had to threaten Hubert Turnour with the police\
court: this seemed to have calmed the young man\'92s nerves somewhat, for\
he kept quite quiet after that, ceased to call on Mrs. Brackenbury,\
and subsequently sent the future Countess a wedding present.\
\
\'93When the Count and Countess Collini, accompanied by Mrs. Brackenbury,\
arrived at the Lord Warden, Alice found a letter awaiting her there.\
It was from Hubert Turnour. In it he begged for forgiveness for all\
the annoyance he had caused her, hoped that she would always look upon\
him as a friend, and finally expressed a strong desire to see her once\
more before her departure for abroad, saying that he would be in Dover\
either this same day or the next, and would give himself the pleasure\
of calling upon her and her husband.\
\
\'93Effectively at about eight o\'92clock, when the wedding party was just\
sitting down to dinner, Hubert Turnour was announced. Every one was\
most cordial to him, agreeing to let bygones be bygones: the Count,\
especially, was most genial and pleasant towards his former rival, and\
insisted upon his staying and dining with them.\
\
\'93Later on in the evening, Hubert Turnour took an affectionate leave of\
the ladies, Count Collini offering to walk back with him to the Grand\
Hotel, where he was staying. The two men went out together, and\'97well!\
you know the rest!\'97for that was the last the young Countess Collini\
ever saw of her husband. He disappeared as effectually, as completely,\
as if the sea had swallowed him up.\
\
\'93\'91And so it had,\'92 say the public,\'94 continued the man in the corner,\
after a slight pause, \'93that delicious, short-sighted, irresponsible\
public is wondering, to this day, why Hubert Turnour was not hung for\
the murder of that Count Collini.\'94\
\
\'93Well! and why wasn\'92t he?\'94 I retorted.\
\
\'93For the very simple reason,\'94 he replied, \'93that in this country you\
cannot hang a man for murder unless there is proof positive that a\
murder has been committed. Now, there was absolutely no proof that the\
Count was murdered at all. What happened was this: the Countess\
Collini and Mrs. Brackenbury became anxious as time went on and the\
Count did not return. One o\'92clock, then two in the morning, and their\
anxiety became positive alarm. At last, as Alice was verging on\
hysterics, Mrs. Brackenbury, in spite of the lateness of the hour,\
went round to the police station.\
\
\'93It was, of course, too late to do anything in the middle of the\
night; the constable on duty tried to reassure the unfortunate lady,\
and promised to send word round to the Lord Warden at the earliest\
possible opportunity in the morning.\
\
\'93Mrs. Brackenbury went back with a heavy heart. No doubt Mr. Turnour\'92s\
sensible letters from Reading recurred to her mind. She had already\
ascertained from the distracted bride that the Count had taken the\
strange precaution to keep in his own pocket-book the \'a380,000, now\
converted into French and Italian banknotes, and Mrs. Brackenbury\
feared not so much that he had met with some accident, but that he had\
absconded with the whole of his girl-wife\'92s fortune.\
\
\'93The next morning brought but scanty news. No one answering to the\
Count\'92s description had met with an accident during the night, or been\
conveyed to a hospital, and no one answering his description had\
crossed over to Calais or Ostend by the night boats. Moreover, Hubert\
Turnour, who presumably had last been in Count Collini\'92s company, had\
left Dover for town by the boat train at 1.50 a.m.\
\
\'93Then the search began in earnest after the missing man, and primarily\
Hubert Turnour was subjected to the closest and most searching\
cross-examination, by one of the most able men on our detective staff,\
Inspector Macpherson.\
\
\'93Hubert Turnour\'92s story was briefly this: He had strolled about on the\
parade with Count Collini for a while. It was a very blustery night,\
the wind blowing a regular gale, and the sea was rolling gigantic\
waves, which looked magnificent, as there was brilliant moonlight.\
\'91Soon after ten o\'92clock,\'92 he continued, \'91the Count and I went back to\
the Grand Hotel, and we had whiskies and sodas up in my room, and a\
bit of a chat until past eleven o\'92clock. Then he said good-night and\
went off.\'92\
\
\'93\'91You saw him down to the hall, of course?\'92 asked the detective.\
\
\'93\'91No, I did not,\'92 replied Hubert Turnour. \'91I had a few letters to\
write, and meant to catch the 1.50 a.m. back to town.\'92\
\
\'93\'91How long were you in Dover altogether?\'92 asked Macpherson carelessly.\
\
\'93\'91Only a few hours. I came down in the afternoon.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Strange, is it not, that you should have taken a room with a private\
sitting-room at an expensive hotel, just for those few hours?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Not at all. I originally meant to stay longer. And my expenses are\
nobody\'92s business, I take it,\'92 replied Hubert Turnour, with some show\
of temper. \'91Anyway,\'92 he added impatiently, after a while, \'91if you\
choose to disbelieve me, you can make inquiries at the hotel, and\
ascertain if I have told the truth.\'92\
\
\'93Undoubtedly he had spoken the truth; at any rate, to that extent.\
Inquiries at the Grand Hotel went to prove that he had arrived there\
in the early part of the afternoon, had engaged a couple of rooms, and\
then gone out. Soon after ten o\'92clock in the evening he came in,\
accompanied by a gentleman, whose description, as given by three\
witnesses, _employ\'e9s_ of the hotel, who saw him, corresponded exactly\
with that of the Count.\
\
\'93Together the two gentlemen went up to Mr. Hubert Turnour\'92s rooms, and\
at half-past ten they ordered whisky to be taken up to them. But at\
this point all trace of Count Collini had completely vanished. The\
passengers arriving by the 10.49 boat train, and who had elected to\
spend the night in Dover, owing to the gale, had crowded up and filled\
the hall.\
\
\'93No one saw Count Collini leave the Grand Hotel. But Mr. Hubert\
Turnour came down into the hall at about half-past eleven. He said he\
would be leaving by the 1.50 a.m. boat train for town, but would walk\
round to the station as he only had a small bag with him. He paid his\
account, then waited in the coffee-room until it was time to go.\
\
\'93And there the matter has remained. Mrs. Brackenbury has spent half\
her own fortune in trying to trace the missing man. She has remained\
perfectly convinced that he slipped across the Channel, taking Alice\
Checkfield\'92s money with him. But, as you know, at all ports of call on\
the South Coast, detectives are perpetually on the watch. The Count\
was a man of peculiar appearance, and there is no doubt that no one\
answering to his description crossed over to France or Belgium that\
night. By the following morning the detectives on both sides of the\
Channel were on the alert. There is no disguise that would have held\
good. If the Count had tried to cross over, he would have been spotted\
either on board or on landing; and we may take it as an absolute and\
positive certainty that he did not cross the Channel.\
\
\'93He remained in England, but in that case, where is he? You would be\
the first to admit that, with the whole of our detective staff at his\
heels, it seems incredible that a man of the Count\'92s singular\
appearance could hide himself so completely as to baffle detection.\
Moreover, the question at once arises, that if he did not cross over\
to France or Belgium, what in the world did he do with the money? What\
was the use of disappearing and living the life of a hunted beast\
hiding for his life, with \'a380,000 worth of foreign money, which was\
practically useless to him?\
\
\'93Now, I told you from the first,\'94 concluded the man in the corner,\
with a dry chuckle, \'93that this strange episode contained no\
sensational incident, nor dramatic inquest or criminal procedure.\
Merely the complete, total disappearance, one may almost call it\
extinction, of a striking-looking man, in the midst of our vaunted\
civilisation, and in spite of the untiring energy and constant watch\
of a whole staff of able men.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93Very well, then,\'94 I retorted in triumph, \'93that proves that Hubert\
Turnour murdered Count Collini out of revenge, not for greed of money,\
and probably threw the body of his victim, together with the foreign\
banknotes, into the sea.\'94\
\
\'93But where? When? How?\'94 he asked, smiling good-humouredly at me over\
his great bone-rimmed spectacles.\
\
\'93Ah! that I don\'92t know.\'94\
\
\'93No, I thought not,\'94 he rejoined placidly. \'93You had, I think,\
forgotten one incident, namely, that Hubert Turnour, accompanied by\
the Count, was in the former\'92s room at the Grand Hotel drinking whisky\
at half-past ten o\'92clock. You must admit that, even though the hall of\
the hotel was very crowded later on, a man would nevertheless find it\
somewhat difficult to convey the body of his murdered enemy through a\
whole concourse of people.\'94\
\
\'93He did not murder the Count in the hotel,\'94 I argued. \'93The two men\
walked out again, when the hall was crowded, and they passed\
unnoticed. Hubert Turnour led the Count to a lonely part of the\
cliffs, then threw him into the sea.\'94\
\
\'93The nearest point at which the cliffs might be called \'91lonely\'92 for\
purposes of a murder, is at least twenty minutes\'92 walk from the Grand\
Hotel,\'94 he said, with a smile, \'93always supposing that the Count walked\
quickly and willingly to such a lonely spot at eleven o\'92clock at\
night, and with a man who had already, more than once, threatened his\
life. Mr. Hubert Turnour, remember, was seen in the hall of the hotel\
at half-past eleven, after which hour he only left the hotel to go to\
the station after 1 o\'92clock a.m.\
\
\'93The hall was crowded by the passengers from the boat train a little\
after eleven. There was no time between that and half-past to lead\
even a willing enemy to the slaughter, throw him into the sea, and\
come back again, all in the space of five-and-twenty minutes.\'94\
\
\'93Then what is your explanation of that extraordinary disappearance?\'94 I\
retorted, beginning to feel very cross about it all.\
\
\'93A simple one,\'94 he rejoined quietly, as he once more began to fidget\
with his bit of string. \'93A very simple one indeed; namely, that Count\
Collini, at the present moment, is living comfortably in England,\
calmly awaiting a favourable opportunity of changing his foreign money\
back into English notes.\'94\
\
\'93But you say yourself that that is impossible, as the most able\
detectives in England are on the watch for him.\'94\
\
\'93They are on the watch for a certain Count Collini,\'94 he said drily,\
\'93who might disguise himself, perhaps, but whose hidden identity would\
sooner or later be discovered by one of these intelligent human\
bloodhounds.\'94\
\
\'93Yes? Well?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Well, that Count Collini never existed. It was _his_ personality that\
was the disguise. Now it is thrown off. The Count is not dead, he is\
not hiding, but has merely ceased to exist. There is no fear that he\
will ever come to life again. Mr. Turnour senior will see to that.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Turnour!\'94 I ejaculated.\
\
\'93Why, yes,\'94 he rejoined excitedly; \'93do you mean to tell me you never\
saw through it all? The money lying in his hands; his brother about to\
wed the rich heiress; then Mrs. Brackenbury\'92s matrimonial ambitions,\
Alice Checkfield\'92s coldness to Hubert Turnour, the golden prize\
slipping away right out of the family for ever. Then the scheme was\
evolved by those two scoundrels, who deserve to be called geniuses in\
their criminal way. It could not be managed, except by collaboration,\
but as it was, the scheme was perfect in conception, and easy of\
execution.\
\
\'93Remember that disguise _previous_ to a crime is always fairly safe\
from detection, for then it has no suspicion to contend against, it\
merely deceives those who have no cause to be otherwise _but_\
deceived. Mrs. Brackenbury lived in London, Reginald Turnour in\
Reading; they did not know each other personally, nor did they know\
each other\'92s friends, of course; whilst Alice Checkfield had not seen\
her guardian since she was quite a child.\
\
\'93Then the disguise was so perfect. I went down to Reading, some little\
time ago, and Reginald Turnour was pointed out to me: he is a\
Scotchman, with very light, sandy hair. That face clean shaved, made\
swarthy, the hair, eyebrows, and lashes dyed a jet black, would render\
him absolutely unrecognisable. Add to this the fact that a foreign\
accent completely changes the voice, and that the slight limp was a\
masterstroke of genius to hide the general carriage.\
\
\'93Then the winter came round; it was, perhaps, important that Mr.\
Turnour should not be absent too long from Reading, for fear of\
exciting suspicion there; and the scoundrel played his part with\
marvellous skill. Can\'92t you see him yourself leaving the Carlton\
Hotel, ostensibly going abroad, driving to Charing Cross, but only\
booking to Cannon Street.\
\
\'93Then getting out at that crowded station and slipping round to his\
brother\'92s office in one of those huge blocks of buildings where there\
is perpetual coming and going, and where any individual would easily\
pass unperceived.\
\
\'93There, with the aid of a little soap and water, Mr. Turnour resumed\
his Scotch appearance, went on to Reading, and spent winter and spring\
there, only returning to London to make a formal proposal, as Count\
Collini, for Alice Checkfield\'92s hand. Hubert Turnour\'92s office was\
undoubtedly the place where he changed his identity, from that of the\
British middle-class man, to the interesting personality of the\
Italian nobleman.\
\
\'93He had, of course, to repeat the journey to Reading a day or two\
before his wedding, in order to hand over his ward\'92s fortune to Mrs.\
Brackenbury\'92s solicitor. Then there were the supposed rows between\
Hubert Turnour and his rival; the letters of warning from the\
guardian, for which Hubert no doubt journeyed down to Reading, in\
order to post them there: all this was dust thrown into the eyes of\
two credulous ladies.\
\
\'93After that came the wedding, the meeting with Hubert Turnour, who,\
you see, was obliged to take a room in one of the big hotels, wherein,\
with more soap and water, the Italian Count could finally disappear.\
When the hall of the hotel was crowded, the sandy-haired Scotchman\
slipped out of it quite quietly: he was not remarkable, and no one\
specially noticed him. Since then the hue and cry has been after a\
dark Italian, who limps, and speaks broken English; and it has never\
struck any one that such a person never existed.\
\
\'93Mr. Turnour is fairly safe by now; and we may take it for granted\
that he will not seek the acquaintanceship of the Brackenburys, whilst\
Alice Checkfield is no longer his ward. He will wait a year or two\
longer perhaps, then he and Hubert will begin quietly to re-convert\
their foreign money into English notes\'97they will take frequent little\
trips abroad, and gradually change the money at the various _bureaux\
de change_, on the Continent.\
\
\'93Think of it all\'97it is so simple\'97not even dramatic, only the work of a\
genius from first to last, worthy of a better cause, perhaps, but\
undoubtedly worthy of success.\'94\
\
He was gone, leaving me quite bewildered. Yet the disappearance had\
always puzzled me, and now I felt that that animated scarecrow had\
found the true explanation of it after all.\
\
\
\
X. The Ayrsham Mystery\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93I have never had a great opinion of our detective force here in\
England,\'94 said the man in the corner, in his funny, gentle, apologetic\
manner, \'93but the way that department mismanaged the affair at Ayrsham\
simply passes comprehension.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed?\'94 I said, with all the quiet dignity I could command. \'93It is a\
pity they did not consult you in the matter, wasn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93It is a pity,\'94 he retorted with aggravating meekness, \'93that they do\
not use a little common sense. The case resembles that of Columbus\'92\
egg, and is every bit as simple.\
\
\'93It was one evening last October, wasn\'92t it? that two labourers,\
walking home from Ayrsham village, turned down a lane, which, it\
appears, is a short cut to the block of cottages some distance off,\
where they lodged.\
\
\'93The night was very dark, and there was a nasty drizzle in the air. In\
the picturesque vernacular of the two labourers, \'91You couldn\'92t see\
your \'92and before your eyes.\'92 Suddenly they stumbled over the body of a\
man lying right across the path.\
\
\'93\'91At first we thought \'92e was drunk,\'92 explained one of them\
subsequently, \'91but when we took a look at \'92im, we soon saw there was\
something very wrong. Me and my mate turned \'92im over, and \'93foul play\'94\
we both says at once. Then we see that it was Old Man Newton. Poor\
chap, \'92e was dead, and no mistake.\'92\
\
\'93Old Man Newton, as he was universally called by his large circle of\
acquaintances, was very well known throughout the entire\
neighbourhood, most particularly at every inn and public bar for some\
miles around.\
\
\'93He also kept a local sweet-stuff shop at Ayrsham. No wonder that the\
men were horrified at finding him in such a terrible condition; even\
in their uneducated minds there could be no doubt that the old man had\
been murdered, for his skull had been literally shattered by a fearful\
blow, dealt him from behind by some powerful assailant.\
\
\'93Whilst the labourers were cogitating as to what they had better do\
next, they heard footsteps also turning into the lane, and the next\
moment Samuel Holder, a well-known inhabitant of Ayrsham, arrived upon\
the scene.\
\
\'93\'91Hello! is that you, Mat Newton?\'92 shouted Samuel, as he came near.\
\
\'93\'91Ay! \'92tis Old Man Newton, right enough,\'92 replied one of the\
labourers, \'91but \'92e won\'92t answer you no more.\'92\
\
\'93Samuel Holder seemed absolutely horrified when he saw the body of Old\
Man Newton; he uttered various ejaculations, which the two labourers,\
however, did not take special notice of at the time.\
\
\'93Then the three men held a brief consultation together, with the\
result that one of them ran back to Ayrsham village to fetch the local\
police, whilst the two others remained in the lane to guard the body.\
\
\'93The mystery\'97for it seemed one from the first\'97created a great deal of\
sensation in Ayrsham and all round the neighbourhood, and much\
sympathy was felt for, and shown to Mary Newton, the murdered man\'92s\
only child, a young girl about two-or-three-and-twenty, who, moreover,\
was in ill-health.\
\
\'93True, Old Man Newton was not a satisfactory protector for a young\
girl. He was very much addicted to drink; he neglected the little bit\
of local business he had; and, moreover, had recently shamefully\
ill-treated his daughter, the neighbours testifying to the many and\
loud quarrels that occurred in the small back parlour behind the\
sweet-stuff shop.\
\
\'93A case of murder\'97the moment an element of mystery hovers around\
it\'97immediately excites the attention of the newspaper-reading public,\
who is always seeking for new sensations.\
\
\'93Very soon the history of Old Man Newton and of his daughter found its\
way into the London and provincial dailies, and the Ayrsham murder\
became a topic of all-absorbing interest.\
\
\'93It appears that Old Man Newton was at one time a highly respectable\
local tradesman, always in a very small way, as there is not much\
business doing at Ayrsham. It is a poor and straggling village,\
although its railway station is an important junction on the Midland\
system.\
\
\'93There is some very good shooting in the neighbourhood, and about four\
or five years ago some of it, together with \'91The Limes,\'92 a pretty\
house just outside the village, was rented for the autumn by Mr.\
Ledbury and his brother.\
\
\'93You know the firm of Ledbury and Co., do you not; the great small\
arms manufacturers? The elder Mr. Ledbury was the recipient of\
Birthday honours last year, and is the present Lord Walterton; his\
younger brother, Mervin, was in those days, and is still, a handsome\
young fellow in the Hussars.\
\
\'93At the time\'97I mean about five years ago\'97Mary Newton was the local\
beauty of Ayrsham; she did a little dressmaking in her odd moments,\
but it appears that she spent most of her time in flirting. She was\
nominally engaged to be married to Samuel Holder, a young carpenter,\
but there was a good deal of scandal talked about her, for she was\
thought to be very fast; village gossip coupled her name with that of\
several young men in the neighbourhood, who were known to have paid\
the village beauty marked attention, and among these admirers of Mary\
Newton during the autumn of which I am speaking, young Mr. Mervin\
Ledbury figured conspicuously.\
\
\'93Be that as it may, certain it is that Mary Newton had a very bad\
reputation among the scandalmongers of Ayrsham, and though everybody\
was shocked, no one was astonished when one fine day in the winter\
following she suddenly left her father and her home, and went no one\
knew whither. She left, it appears, a very pathetic letter behind,\
begging for her father\'92s forgiveness, and that of Samuel Holder, whom\
she was jilting, but she was going to marry a gentleman above them all\
in station, and was going to be a real lady; then only would she\
return home.\
\
\'93A very unusual village tragedy, as you see. Four years went by, and\
Mary Newton did not return home. As time went by and with it no news\
of his daughter, Old Man Newton took her disappearance very much to\
heart. He began to neglect his business, and then his house, which\
became dirty and ill-kept by an occasional charwoman who would do a\
bit of promiscuous tidying for him from time to time. He was\
ill-tempered, sullen, and morose, and very soon became hopelessly\
addicted to drink.\
\
\'93Then suddenly, as unexpectedly as she had gone, Mary Newton returned\
to her home one fine day, after an absence of four years. What had\
become of her in the interim, no one in the village ever knew; she was\
generally supposed to have earned a living by dressmaking, until her\
failing health had driven her well nigh to starvation, and then back\
to the home and her father she had so heedlessly left.\
\
\'93Needless to say that all the talk of her \'91marriage with a gentleman\
above her in station\'92 was entirely at an end. As for Old Man Newton,\
he seems after his daughter\'92s return to have become more sullen and\
morose than ever, and the neighbours now busied themselves with talk\
of the fearful rows which frequently occurred in the back parlour of\
the little sweet-stuff shop.\
\
\'93Father and daughter seemed to be leading a veritable cat-and-dog life\
together. Old Man Newton was hardly ever sober, and at the village\
inns he threw out weird and strange hints about \'91breach of promise\
actions with \'a35,000 damages, which his daughter would get, if only he\
knew where to lay hands upon the scoundrel.\'92\
\
\'93He also made vague and wholly useless enquiries about young Mervin\
Ledbury, but in a sleepy, out-of-the-way village like Ayrsham, no one\
knows anything about what goes on beyond a narrow five-mile radius at\
most. \'91The Limes\'92 and the shooting were let to different tenants year\
after year, and neither Lord Walterton nor Mr. Mervin Ledbury had ever\
rented them again.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93That was the past history of Old Newton,\'94 continued the man in the\
corner, after a brief pause, \'93that is to say, of the man who on a dark\
night last October was found murdered in a lonely lane, not far from\
Ayrsham. The public, as you may well imagine, took a very keen\
interest in the case from the outset: the story of Mary Newton, of the\
threatened breach of promise, of the \'a35,000 damages, roused masses of\
conjecture to which no one has yet dared to give definite shape.\
\
\'93One name, however, had already been whispered significantly, that of\
Mr. Mervin Ledbury, the young Hussar, one of Mary Newton\'92s admirers at\
the very time she left home in order, as she said, to be married to\
some one above her in station.\
\
\'93Many thinking people, too, wanted to know what Samuel Holder, Mary\'92s\
jilted _fianc\'e9_, was doing close to the scene of the murder that\
night, and how he came to make the remark: \'91Hello! Is that you, Mat\
Newton?\'92 when the Old Man lived nearly half-a-mile away, and really\
had no cause for being in that particular lane, at that hour of the\
night in the drizzling rain.\
\
\'93The inquest, which, for want of other accommodation, was held at the\
local police station, was, as you may imagine, very largely attended.\
\
\'93I had read a brief statement of the case in the London papers, and\
had hurried down to Ayrsham Junction, as I scented a mystery, and knew\
I should enjoy myself.\
\
\'93When I got there, the room was already packed, and the medical\
evidence was being gone through.\
\
\'93Old Man Newton, it appears, had been knocked on the head by a\
heavily-loaded cane, which was found in the ditch close to the\
murdered man\'92s body.\
\
\'93The cane was produced in court; it was as stout as an old-fashioned\
club, and of terrific weight. The man who wielded it must have been\
very powerful, for he had only dealt one blow, but that blow had\
cracked the old man\'92s skull. The cane was undoubtedly of foreign make,\
for it had a solid silver ferrule at one end, which was not English\
hall-marked.\
\
\'93In the opinion of the medical expert, death was the result of the\
blow, and must have been almost instantaneous.\
\
\'93The labourers who first came across the body of the murdered man then\
repeated their story; they had nothing new to add, and their evidence\
was of no importance. But after that there was some stir in the court.\
Samuel Holder had been called and sworn to tell the whole truth, and\
nothing but the truth.\
\
\'93He was a youngish, heavily-built man of about five-and-thirty, with a\
nervous, not altogether prepossessing expression of face. Pressed by\
the coroner, he gave us a few details of Old Man Newton\'92s earlier\
history, such as I have already told you.\
\
\'93\'91Old Mat,\'92 he explained, with some hesitation, \'91was for ever wanting\
to find out who the gentleman was who had promised marriage to Mary\
four years ago. But Mary was that obstinate, and wouldn\'92t tell him,\
and this exasperated the old man terribly, so that they had many rows\
on the subject.\'92\
\
\'93\'91I suppose,\'92 said the coroner tentatively, \'91that you never knew who\
that gentleman was?\'92\
\
\'93Samuel Holder seemed to hesitate for a moment. His manner became even\
more nervous than before; he shifted his position from one foot to the\
other; finally, he said:\
\
\'93\'91I don\'92t know as I ought to say, but\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93\'91I am quite sure that you must tell us everything you know which\
might throw light upon this extraordinary and terrible murder,\'92\
retorted the coroner sternly.\
\
\'93\'91Well,\'92 replied Samuel Holder, whilst great beads of perspiration\
stood out upon his forehead, \'91Mary never would give up the letters she\
had had from him, and she would not hear anything about a breach of\
promise case and \'a35,000 damages; but old Mat \'92e often says to me, says\
\'92e, \'93It\'92s young Mr. Ledbury,\'94 \'92e says, \'93she\'92s told me that once. I got\
it out of \'92er, and if I only knew where to find \'92im\'97\'97\'94\'92\
\
\'93\'91You are quite sure of this?\'92 asked the coroner, for Holder had\
paused, and seemed quite horrified at the enormity of what he had\
said.\
\
\'93\'91Yes\'97yes\'97your worship\'97your honour\'97\'97\'92 stammered Holder. \'91\'92E\'92s told me\
\'92twas young Mr. Ledbury times out of count, and\'97\'97\'92\
\
\'93But Samuel Holder here completely broke down; he seemed unable to\
speak, his lips twitched convulsively, and the coroner, fearing that\
the man would faint, had him conveyed into the next room to recover\
himself, whilst another witness was brought forward.\
\
\'93This was Michael Pitkin, landlord of the Fernhead Arms, at Ayrsham,\
who had been on very intimate terms with old Newton during the four\
years which elapsed after Mary\'92s disappearance. He had a very curious\
story to tell, which aroused public excitement to its highest pitch.\
\
\'93It appears that to him also the old man had often confided the fact\
that it was Mr. Ledbury who had promised to marry Mary, and then had\
shamefully left her stranded and moneyless in London.\
\
\'93\'91But, of course,\'92 added the jovial and pleasant-looking landlord of\
the Fernhead Arms, \'91the likes of us down here didn\'92t know what became\
of Mr. Ledbury after he left \'93The Limes,\'94 until one day I reads in the\
local paper that Sir John Fernhead\'92s daughter is going to be married\
to Captain Mervin Ledbury. Of course, your honour and me, and all of\
us know Sir John, our squire, down at Fernhead Towers, and I says to\
old Mat: \'93It strikes me,\'94 I says, \'93that you\'92ve got your man.\'94 Sure\
enough it was the same Mr. Ledbury who rented \'93The Limes\'94 years ago,\
who was engaged to the young lady up at the Towers, and last week\
there was grand doings there\'97lords and ladies and lots of quality\
staying there, and also the Captain.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Well?\'92 asked the coroner eagerly, whilst every one held their\
breath, wondering what was to come.\
\
\'93\'91Well,\'92 continued Michael Pitkin, \'91Old Man Newton went down to the\
Towers one day. \'92E was determined to see young Mr. Ledbury, and went.\
What \'92appened I don\'92t know, for old Mat wouldn\'92t tell me, but he came\
back mighty furious from \'92is visit, and swore \'92e would ruin the young\
man and make no end of a scandal, and he would bring the law agin\'92 \'92im\
and get \'a35,000 damages.\'92\
\
\'93This story, embellished, of course, by many details, was the gist of\
what the worthy landlord of the Fernhead Arms had to say, but you may\
imagine how every one\'92s excitement and curiosity was aroused; in the\
meanwhile Samuel Holder was getting over his nervousness, and was more\
ready to give a clear account of what happened on the fatal night\
itself.\
\
\'93\'91It was about nine o\'92clock,\'92 he explained, in answer to the coroner,\
\'91and I was hurrying back to Ayrsham, through the fields; it was dark\
and raining, and I was about to strike across the hedge into the lane\
when I heard voices\'97a woman\'92s, then a man\'92s. Of course, I could see\
nothing, and the man spoke in a whisper, but I had recognised Mary\'92s\
voice quite plainly. She kept on saying: \'93\'92Tisn\'92t my fault!\'94 she says,\
\'93it\'92s father\'92s, \'92e has made up \'92is mind. I held out as long as I\
could, but \'92e worried me, and now \'92e\'92s got your letters, and it\'92s too\
late.\'94\'92\
\
\'93Samuel Holder again paused a moment, then continued:\
\
\'93\'91They talked together for a long time: Mary seemed very upset and the\
man very angry. Presently \'92e says to \'92er: \'93Well, tell your father to\
come out here and speak to me for a moment. I\'92ll see what I can do.\'94\
Mary seemed to \'92esitate for a time, then she went away, and the man\
waited there in the drizzling rain, with me the other side of the\
\'92edge watchin\'92 \'92im. I waited for a long time, for I wanted to know\
what was going to \'92appen; then time went on. I thought perhaps that\
old Mat was at the Fernhead Arms, and that Mary couldn\'92t find \'92im, so\
I went back to Ayrsham by the fields, \'92oping to find the old man. The\
stranger didn\'92t budge. \'92E seemed inclined to wait\'97so I left \'92im\
there\'97and\'97and\'97that\'92s all. I went to the Fernhead Arms, saw old Mat\
wasn\'92t there\'97then I went back to the lane\'97and\'97Old Man Newton was dead,\
and the stranger was gone.\'92\
\
\'93There was a moment or two of dead silence in the court when Samuel\
Holder had given his evidence, then the coroner asked quietly:\
\
\'93\'91You do not know who the stranger was?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Well, I couldn\'92t be sure, your honour,\'92 replied Samuel nervously,\
\'91it was pitch dark. I wouldn\'92t like to swear a fellow-creature\'92s life\
and character away.\'92\
\
\'93\'91No, no, quite so,\'92 rejoined the coroner; \'91but do you happen to know\
what time it was when all this occurred?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Oh yes, your honour,\'92 said Samuel decisively, \'91as I walked away from\
the Fernhead Arms I \'92eard Ayrsham church clock strike ten o\'92clock.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Ah! that\'92s always something,\'92 said the coroner, with a sigh of\
satisfaction. \'91Call Mary Newton, please.\'92\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93You may imagine,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after a slight\
pause, \'93with what palpitating interest we all watched the pathetic\
little figure, clad in deep black, who now stepped forward to give\
evidence.\
\
\'93It was difficult to imagine that Mary Newton could ever have been\
pretty; trouble had obviously wrought sad havoc with her good looks;\
she was now a wizened little thing, with dark rings under her eyes,\
and a pale, an\'e6mic complexion. She stood perfectly listlessly before\
the coroner, waiting to be questioned, but otherwise not seeming to\
take the slightest interest in the proceedings. In an even, toneless\
voice she told her name, age, and status, then waited for further\
questions.\
\
\'93\'91Your father went out a little before ten o\'92clock on Tuesday night\
last, did he not?\'92 asked the coroner very kindly.\
\
\'93\'91Yes, sir, he did,\'92 replied Mary quietly.\
\
\'93\'91You had brought him a message from a gentleman whom you had met in\
the lane, and who wished to speak with your father?\'92\
\
\'93\'91No, sir,\'92 replied Mary, in the same even and toneless voice; \'91I\
brought no message to father, and he went out on his own.\'92\
\
\'93\'91But the gentleman you met in the lane?\'92 insisted the coroner with\
some impatience.\
\
\'93\'91I didn\'92t meet any one in the lane, sir. I never went out of the\
house that Tuesday night, it rained so.\'92\
\
\'93\'91But the last witness, Samuel Holder, heard you talking in the lane\
at nine o\'92clock.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Samuel Holder was mistaken,\'92 she replied imperturbably; \'91I wasn\'92t\
out of the house the whole of that night.\'92\
\
\'93It would be useless for me,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93to\
attempt to convey to you the intense feeling of excitement which\
pervaded that crowded court, as that wizened little figure stood there\
for over half-an-hour, quietly and obstinately parrying the most rigid\
cross-examination.\
\
\'93That she was lying\'97lying to shield the very man who perhaps had\
murdered her father\'97no one doubted for a single instant. Yet there she\
stood, sullen, apathetic, and defiant, flatly denying Samuel Holder\'92s\
story from end to end, strictly adhering and swearing to her first\
statement, that her father went out \'91on his own,\'92 that she did not\
know where he was going to, and that she herself had never left the\
house that fatal Tuesday night.\
\
\'93It did not seem to occur to her that by these statements she was\
hopelessly incriminating Samuel Holder, whom she was thus openly\
accusing of deliberate lies; on the contrary, many noticed a distinct\
touch of bitter animosity in the young girl against her former\
sweetheart, which was singularly emphasised when the coroner asked her\
whether she approved of the idea of a breach of promise action being\
brought against Mr. Ledbury.\
\
\'93\'91No,\'92 she said; \'91all that talk about damages and breach of promise\
was between father and Sam Holder, because Sam had told father that he\
wouldn\'92t mind marrying me if I had \'a35,000 of my own.\'92\
\
\'93It would be impossible to render the tone of hatred and contempt with\
which the young girl uttered these words. One seemed to live through\
the whole tragedy of the past few months\'97the girl, pestered by the\
greed of her father, yet refusing obstinately to aid in causing a\
scandal, perhaps disgrace, to the man whom she had once loved and\
trusted.\
\
\'93As nothing more could be got out of her, and as circumstances now\
seemed to demand it, the coroner adjourned the inquest. The police, as\
you may well imagine, wanted to make certain enquiries. Mind you, Mary\
Newton flatly refused to mention Mr. Ledbury\'92s name; she was\
questioned and cross-questioned, yet her answer uniformly was:\
\
\'93\'91I don\'92t know what you\'92re talking about. The person I was going to\
marry four years ago has gone out of my life\'97I have never seen him\
since. I saw no one on that Tuesday night.\'92\
\
\'93Against that, when she was asked to swear that it was _not_ Mr.\'97now\
Captain\'97Ledbury who had promised her marriage she flatly refused to do\
so.\
\
\'93Of course, there was not a soul there who had not made up his or her\
mind that Captain Ledbury _had_ met Mary Newton in the lane, and had\
heard from her that all his love letters to her were now in her\
father\'92s hands, and that the old man meant to use these in order to\
extort money from him.\
\
\'93Fearing the exposure and disgrace of so sensational a breach of\
promise action, and not having the money with which to meet Mat\
Newton\'92s preposterous demands, he probably lost control over himself,\
and in a moment of impulse and mad rage had silenced the old man for\
ever.\
\
\'93I assure you that at the adjourned inquest everybody expected to see\
Captain Ledbury in the custody of two constables. The police in the\
interim had been extremely reticent, and no fresh details of the\
extraordinary case had found its way into the papers, but fresh\
details of a sensational character were fully expected, and I can\
assure you the public were not disappointed.\
\
\'93It is no use my telling you all the proceedings of that second most\
memorable day; I will try and confine myself to the most important\
points of this interesting mystery.\
\
\'93I must tell you that the story told by the landlord of the Fernhead\
Arms was fully corroborated by several witnesses, all of whom\
testified to the fact that the old man came back from his visit to\
Fernhead Towers in a terrible fury, swearing to bring disgrace upon\
the scoundrel who had ruined his daughter.\
\
\'93What occurred during that visit was explained by Edward Sanders, the\
butler at The Towers. According to the testimony of this witness,\
there was a large house-party staying with Sir John Fernhead to\
celebrate the engagement of his daughter; the party naturally included\
Captain Mervin Ledbury, his brother, Lord Walterton, with the latter\'92s\
newly-married young wife, also many neighbours and friends.\
\
\'93At about six o\'92clock on Monday evening, it appears, a\
disreputable-looking old man, whom Edward Sanders did not know, but\
who gave the name of Newton, rang at the front door bell of The Towers\
and demanded to see Mr. Ledbury. Sanders naturally refused to admit\
him, but the old man was so persistent, and used such strange\
language, that the butler, after much hesitation, decided to apprise\
Captain Ledbury of his extraordinary visitor.\
\
\'93Captain Ledbury, on hearing that Old Man Newton wished to speak to\
him, much to Sanders\'92 astonishment, came downstairs and elected to\
interview his extraordinary visitor in the dining-room, which was then\
deserted. Sanders showed the old man in, and waited in the hall. Very\
soon, however, he heard loud and angry voices, and the next moment\
Captain Ledbury threw open the dining-room door, and said:\
\
\'93\'91This man is mad or drunk; show him out, Sanders.\'92\
\
\'93And without another word the Captain walked upstairs, leaving Sanders\
the pleasant task of \'91showing the old man out.\'92 That this was done\
very speedily and pretty roughly we may infer from Old Man Newton\'92s\
subsequent fury, and the threats he uttered even while he was being\
\'91shown out.\'92\
\
\'93Now you see, do you not?\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93that this\
evidence seemed to add another link to the chain which was\
incriminating young Mr. Ledbury in this terrible charge of murdering\
Old Man Newton.\
\
\'93The young man himself was now with his regiment stationed at York. It\
appears that the house-party at Fernhead Towers was breaking up on the\
very day of Old Man Newton\'92s strange visit thither. Lord and Lady\
Walterton left for town on the Tuesday morning, and Captain Ledbury\
went up to York on that very same fatal night.\
\
\'93You must know that the small local station of Fernhead is quite close\
to The Towers. Captain Ledbury took the late local train there for\
Ayrsham Junction after dinner that night, arriving at the latter place\
at 9.15, with the intention of picking up the Midland express to the\
north at 10.15 p.m. later on.\
\
\'93The police had ascertained that Captain Ledbury had got out of the\
local train at Ayrsham Junction at 9.15, and aimlessly strolled out of\
the station. Against that, it was definitely proved by several\
witnesses that the young man did catch the Midland express at 10.15\
p.m., and travelled up north by it.\
\
\'93Now, there was the hitch, do you see?\'94 added the funny creature\
excitedly. \'93Samuel Holder overheard a conversation in the fatal lane\
between Mary Newton and the stranger, whom everybody by now believed\
to be Captain Ledbury. Good! That was between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., and,\
as it happened, the young man does seem to have unaccountably strolled\
about in the neighbourhood whilst waiting for his train; but remember\
that when Sam Holder left the stranger waiting in the lane, and went\
back towards Ayrsham in order to try and find Old Man Newton, he\
distinctly heard Ayrsham church clock striking ten.\
\
\'93Now, the lane where the murder occurred is two-and-a-half miles from\
Ayrsham Junction station, therefore it could not have been Captain\
Ledbury who was there lying in wait for the old man, as he could not\
possibly have had his interview with old Mat, quarrelled with him and\
murdered him, and then caught his train two-and-a-half miles further\
on, all in the space of fifteen minutes.\
\
\'93Thus, even before the final verdict of \'91Wilful murder against some\
person or persons unknown,\'92 the case against Captain Mervin Ledbury\
had completely fallen to the ground. He must also have succeeded in\
convincing Sir John Fernhead of his innocence, as I see by the papers\
that Miss Fernhead has since become Mrs. Ledbury.\
\
\'93But the result has been that the Ayrsham tragedy has remained an\
impenetrable mystery.\
\
\'93\'91Who killed Old Man Newton? and why?\'92 is a question which many\
people, including our clever criminal investigation department, have\
asked themselves many a time.\
\
\'93It was not a case of vulgar assault and robbery, as the old man was\
not worth robbing, and the few coppers he possessed were found intact\
in his waistcoat pocket.\
\
\'93Many people assert that Samuel Holder quarrelled with the old man and\
murdered him, but there are three reasons why that theory is bound to\
fall to the ground. Firstly, the total absence of any motive. Samuel\
Holder could have no possible object in killing the old man, but\
still, we\'92ll waive that; people do quarrel\'97especially if they are\
confederates, as these two undoubtedly were\'97and quarrels do sometimes\
end fatally. Secondly, the weapon which caused the old man\'92s death\'97a\
heavily-leaded cane of foreign make, with solid silver ferrule.\
\
\'93Now, I ask you, where in the world could a village carpenter pick up\
an instrument of that sort? Moreover no one ever saw such a thing in\
Sam Holder\'92s hands or in his house. When he walked to the Fernhead\
Arms in order to try and find the old man, he had nothing of the sort\
in his hand, and in spite of the most strenuous efforts on the part of\
the police, the history of that cane was never traced.\
\
\'93Then, there is a third reason why obviously Sam Holder was not guilty\
of the murder, though that reason is a moral one; I am referring to\
Mary Newton\'92s attitude at the inquest. She lied, of that there could\
not be a shadow of doubt; she was determined to shield her former\
lover, and incriminated Sam Holder only because she wished to save\
another man.\
\
\'93Obviously, old Newton went out on that dark, wet night in order to\
meet someone in the lane, that someone could not have been Sam Holder,\
whom he met anywhere and everywhere, and every day in his own house.\
\
\'93There! you see that Sam Holder was obviously innocent, that Captain\
Ledbury could not have committed the murder, that surely Mary Newton\
did not kill her own father, and that in such a case, common sense\
should have come to the rescue, and not have left this case, what it\
now is, a tragic and impenetrable mystery.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93But,\'94 I said at last, for indeed I was deeply mystified, \'93what does\
common sense argue?\'97the case seems to be absolutely hopeless.\'94\
\
He surveyed his beloved bit of string for a moment, and his mild blue\
eyes blinked at me over his bone-rimmed spectacles.\
\
\'93Common sense,\'94 he said at last, with his most apologetic manner,\
\'93tells me that Ayrsham village is a remote little place, where a daily\
paper is unknown, and where no one reads the fashionable intelligence\
or knows anything about Birthday honours.\'94\
\
\'93What _do_ you mean?\'94 I gasped in amazement.\
\
\'93Simply this, that no one at Ayrsham village, certainly not Mary\
Newton herself, had realised that one of the Mr. Ledburys, whom all\
had known at \'91The Limes\'92 four years ago, had since become Lord\
Walterton.\'94\
\
\'93Lord Walterton!\'94 I ejaculated, wholly incredulously.\
\
\'93Why, yes!\'94 he replied quietly. \'93Do you mean to say you never thought\
of that? that it never occurred to you that Mary Newton may have\
admitted to her father that Mr. Ledbury had been the man who had so\
wickedly wronged her, but that she, in her remote little village, had\
also no idea that the Mr. Ledbury she meant was recently made, and is\
now styled, Lord Walterton?\
\
\'93Old Man Newton, who knew of the gossip which had coupled his\
daughter\'92s name, years ago, with the younger Mr. Ledbury, naturally\
took it for granted that she was referring to him. Moreover, we may\
take it from the girl\'92s subsequent attitude that she did all she could\
to shield the man whom she had once loved; women, you know, have that\
sort of little way with them.\
\
\'93Old Newton, fully convinced that young Ledbury was the man he wanted,\
went up to The Towers and had the stormy interview, which no doubt\
greatly puzzled the young Hussar. He undoubtedly spoke of it to his\
brother, Lord Walterton, who, newly married and of high social\
position, would necessarily dread a scandal as much as anybody.\
\
\'93Lord Walterton went up to town with his young wife the following\
morning. Ayrsham is only forty minutes from London. He came down in\
the evening, met Mary in the lane, asked to see her father, and killed\
him in a moment of passion, when he found that the old man\'92s demands\
were preposterously unreasonable. Moreover, Englishmen in all grades\
of society have an innate horror of being bullied or blackmailed; the\
murder probably was not premeditated, but the outcome of rage at being\
browbeaten by the old man.\
\
\'93You see, the police did not use their common sense over so simple a\
matter. They naturally made no enquiries as to Lord Walterton\'92s\
movements, who seemingly had absolutely nothing to do with the case.\
If they had, I feel convinced that they would have found that his\
lordship would have had some difficulty in satisfying everybody as to\
his whereabouts on that particular Tuesday night.\
\
\'93Think of it, it is so simple\'97the only possible solution of that\
strange and unaccountable mystery.\'94\
\
\
\
XI. The Affair at the Novelty Theatre\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93Talking of mysteries,\'94 said the man in the corner, rather\
irrelevantly, for he had not opened his mouth since he sat down and\
ordered his lunch, \'93talking of mysteries, it is always a puzzle to me\
how few thefts are committed in the dressing-rooms of fashionable\
actresses during a performance.\'94\
\
\'93There have been one or two,\'94 I suggested, \'93but nothing of any value\
was stolen.\'94\
\
\'93Yet you remember that affair at the Novelty Theatre a year or two\
ago, don\'92t you?\'94 he added. \'93It created a great deal of sensation at\
the time. You see, Miss Phyllis Morgan was, and still is, a very\
fashionable and popular actress, and her pearls are quite amongst the\
wonders of the world. She herself valued them at \'a310,000, and several\
experts who remember the pearls quite concur with that valuation.\
\
\'93During the period of her short tenancy of the Novelty Theatre last\
season, she entrusted those beautiful pearls to Mr. Kidd, the\
well-known Bond Street jeweller, to be re-strung. There were seven\
rows of perfectly matched pearls, held together by a small diamond\
clasp of \'91art-nouveau\'92 design.\
\
\'93Kidd and Co. are, as you know, a very eminent and old established\
firm of jewellers. Mr. Thomas Kidd, its present sole representative,\
was some time president of the London Chamber of Commerce, and a man\
whose integrity has always been held to be above suspicion. His\
clerks, salesmen, and book-keeper had all been in his employ for\
years, and most of the work was executed on the premises.\
\
\'93In the case of Miss Phyllis Morgan\'92s valuable pearls they were\
re-strung and re-set in the back shop by Mr. Kidd\'92s most valued and\
most trusted workman, a man named James Rumford, who is justly\
considered to be one of the cleverest craftsmen here in England.\
\
\'93When the pearls were ready, Mr. Kidd himself took them down to the\
theatre, and delivered them into Miss Morgan\'92s own hands.\
\
\'93It appears that the worthy jeweller was extremely fond of the\
theatre; but, like so many persons in affluent circumstances, he was\
also very fond of getting a free seat when he could.\
\
\'93All along he had made up his mind to take the pearls down to the\
Novelty Theatre one night, and to see Miss Morgan for a moment before\
the performance; she would then, he hoped, place a stall at his\
disposal.\
\
\'93His previsions were correct. Miss Morgan received the pearls, and Mr.\
Kidd was on that celebrated night accommodated with a seat in the\
stalls.\
\
\'93I don\'92t know if you remember all the circumstances connected with\
that case, but, to make my point clear, I must remind you of one or\
two of the most salient details.\
\
\'93In the drama in which Miss Phyllis Morgan was acting at the time,\
there is a brilliant masked ball scene which is the crux of the whole\
play; it occurs in the second act, and Miss Phyllis Morgan, as the\
hapless heroine, dressed in the shabbiest of clothes, appears in the\
midst of a gay and giddy throng; she apostrophises all and sundry\
there, including the villain, and has a magnificent scene which always\
brings down the house, and nightly adds to her histrionic laurels.\
\
\'93For this scene a large number of supers are engaged, and in order to\
further swell the crowd, practically all the available stage hands\
have to \'91walk on\'92 dressed in various coloured dominoes, and all\
wearing masks.\
\
\'93You have, of course, heard the name of Mr. Howard Dennis in\
connection with this extraordinary mystery. He is what is usually\
called \'91a young man about town,\'92 and was one of Miss Phyllis Morgan\'92s\
most favoured admirers. As a matter of fact, he was generally\
understood to be the popular actress\'92s _fianc\'e9_, and as such, had of\
course the _entr\'e9e_ of the Novelty Theatre.\
\
\'93Like many another idle young man about town, Mr. Howard Dennis was\
stage-mad, and one of his greatest delights was to don nightly a mask\
and a blue domino, and to \'91walk on\'92 in the second act, not so much in\
order to gratify his love for the stage, as to watch Miss Phyllis\
Morgan in her great scene, and to be present, close by her, when she\
received her usual salvo of enthusiastic applause from a delighted\
public.\
\
\'93On this eventful night\'97it was on 20th July last\'97the second act was in\
full swing; the supers, the stage hands, and all the principals were\
on the scene, the back of the stage was practically deserted. The\
beautiful pearls, fresh from the hands of Mr. Kidd, were in Miss\
Morgan\'92s dressing-room, as she meant to wear them in the last act.\
\
\'93Of course, since that memorable affair, many people have talked of\
the foolhardiness of leaving such valuable jewellery in the sole\
charge of a young girl\'97Miss Morgan\'92s dresser\'97who acted with\
unpardonable folly and carelessness, but you must remember that this\
part of the theatre is only accessible through the stage door, where\
sits enthroned that uncorruptible dragon, the stage door-keeper.\
\
\'93No one can get at it from the front, and the dressing-rooms for the\
supers and lesser members of the company are on the opposite side of\
the stage to that reserved for Miss Morgan and one or two of the\
principals.\
\
\'93It was just a quarter to ten, and the curtain was about to be rung\
down, when George Finch, the stage door-keeper, rushed excitedly into\
the wings; he was terribly upset, and was wildly clutching his coat,\
beneath which he evidently held something concealed.\
\
\'93In response to the rapidly-whispered queries of the one or two stage\
hands that stood about, Finch only shook his head excitedly. He seemed\
scarcely able to control his impatience, during the close of the act,\
and the subsequent prolonged applause.\
\
\'93When at last Miss Morgan, flushed with her triumph, came off the\
stage, Finch made a sudden rush for her.\
\
\'93\'91Oh, Madam!\'92 he gasped excitedly, \'91it might have been such an awful\
misfortune! The rascal! I nearly got him through! but he\
escaped\'97fortunately it is safe\'97\'97 I have got it\'97\'97!\'92\
\
\'93It was some time before Miss Morgan understood what in the world the\
otherwise sober stage door-keeper was driving at. Every one who heard\
him certainly thought that he had been drinking. But the next moment\
from under his coat he pulled out, with another ejaculation of\
excitement, the magnificent pearl necklace which Miss Morgan had\
thought safely put away in her dressing-room.\
\
\'93\'91What in the world does all this mean?\'92 asked Mr. Howard Dennis, who,\
as usual, was escorting his _fianc\'e9e_. \'91Finch, what are you doing with\
Madam\'92s necklace?\'92\
\
\'93Miss Phyllis Morgan herself was too bewildered to question Finch; she\
gazed at him, then at her necklace, in speechless astonishment.\
\
\'93\'91Well, you see, Madam, it was this way,\'92 Finch managed to explain at\
last, as with awestruck reverence he finally deposited the precious\
necklace in the actress\'92s hands. \'91As you know, Madam, it is a very hot\
night. I had seen every one into the theatre and counted in the\
supers; there was nothing much for me to do, and I got rather tired\
and very thirsty. I see\'92d a man loafing close to the door, and I ask\
him to fetch me a pint of beer from round the corner, and I give him\
some coppers; I had noticed him loafing round before, and it was so\
hot I didn\'92t think I was doin\'92 no harm.\'92\
\
\'93\'91No, no,\'92 said Miss Morgan impatiently. \'91Well!\'92\
\
\'93\'91Well,\'92 continued Finch, \'91the man, he brought me the beer, and I had\
some of it\'97and\'97and\'97afterwards, I don\'92t quite know how it happened\'97it\
was the heat, perhaps\'97but\'97I was sitting in my box, and I suppose I\
must have dropped asleep. I just remember hearing the ring up for the\
second act, and the call-boy calling you, Madam, then there\'92s a sort\
of a blank in my mind. All of a sudden I seemed to wake with the\
feeling that there was something wrong somehow. In a moment I jumped\
up, and I tell you I was wide awake then, and I saw a man sneaking\
down the passage, past my box, towards the door. I challenged him, and\
he tried to dart past me, but I was too quick for him, and got him by\
the tails of his coat, for I saw at once that he was carrying\
something, and I had recognised the loafer who brought me the beer. I\
shouted for help, but there\'92s never anybody about in this back street,\
and the loafer, he struggled like old Harry, and sure enough he\
managed to get free from me and away before I could stop him, but in\
his fright the rascal dropped his booty, for which Heaven be praised!\
and it was your pearls, Madam. Oh, my! but I did have a tussle,\'92\
concluded the worthy door-keeper, mopping his forehead, \'91and I do\
hope, Madam, the scoundrel didn\'92t take nothing else.\'92\
\
\'93That was the story,\'94 continued the man in the corner, \'93which George\
Finch had to tell, and which he subsequently repeated without the\
slightest deviation. Miss Phyllis Morgan, with the light-heartedness\
peculiar to ladies of her profession, took the matter very quietly;\
all she said at the time was that she had nothing else of value in her\
dressing-room, but that Miss Knight\'97the dresser\'97deserved a scolding\
for leaving the room unprotected.\
\
\'93\'91All\'92s well that ends well,\'92 she said gaily, as she finally went into\
her dressing-room, carrying the pearls in her hand.\
\
\'93It appears that the moment she opened the door, she found Miss Knight\
sitting in the room, in a deluge of tears. The girl had overheard\
George Finch telling his story, and was terribly upset at her own\
carelessness.\
\
\'93In answer to Miss Morgan\'92s questions, she admitted that she had gone\
into the wings, and lingered there to watch the great actress\'92s\
beautiful performance. She thought no one could possibly get to the\
dressing-room, as nearly all hands were on the stage at the time, and\
of course George Finch was guarding the door.\
\
\'93However, as there really had been no harm done, beyond a wholesome\
fright to everybody concerned, Miss Morgan readily forgave the girl\
and proceeded with her change of attire for the next act. Incidentally\
she noticed a bunch of roses, which were placed on her dressing-table,\
and asked Knight who had put them there.\
\
\'93\'91Mr. Dennis brought them,\'92 replied the girl.\
\
\'93Miss Morgan looked pleased, blushed, and dismissing the whole matter\
from her mind, she proceeded with her toilette for the next act, in\
which, the hapless heroine having come into her own again, she was\
able to wear her beautiful pearls around her neck.\
\
\'93George Finch, however, took some time to recover himself; his\
indignation was only equalled by his volubility. When his excitement\
had somewhat subsided, he took the precaution of saving the few drops\
of beer which had remained at the bottom of the mug, brought to him by\
the loafer. This was subsequently shown to a chemist in the\
neighbourhood, who, without a moment\'92s hesitation, pronounced the beer\
to contain an appreciable quantity of chloral.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93The whole matter, as you may imagine, did not affect Miss Morgan\'92s\
spirits that night,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after a slight\
pause.\
\
\'93\'91All\'92s well that ends well,\'92 she had said gaily, since almost by a\
miracle, her pearls were once more safely round her neck.\
\
\'93But the next day brought the rude awakening. Something had indeed\
happened which made the affair at the Novelty Theatre, what it has\
ever since remained, a curious and unexplainable mystery.\
\
\'93The following morning Miss Phyllis Morgan decided that it was\
foolhardy to leave valuable property about in her dressing-room, when\
for stage purposes, imitation jewellery did just as well. She\
therefore determined to place her pearls in the bank until the\
termination of her London season.\
\
\'93The moment, however, that, in broad daylight, she once more handled\
the necklace, she instinctively felt that there was something wrong\
with it. She examined it eagerly and closely, and, hardly daring to\
face her sudden terrible suspicions, she rushed round to the nearest\
jeweller, and begged him to examine the pearls.\
\
\'93The examination did not take many moments: the jeweller at once\
pronounced the pearls to be false. There could be no doubt about it;\
the necklace was a perfect imitation of the original, even the clasp\
was an exact copy. Half-hysterical with rage and anxiety, Miss Morgan\
at once drove to Bond Street, and asked to see Mr. Kidd.\
\
\'93Well, you may easily imagine the stormy interview that took place.\
Miss Phyllis Morgan, in no measured language, boldly accused Mr.\
Thomas Kidd, late president of the London Chamber of Commerce, of\
having substituted false pearls for her own priceless ones.\
\
\'93The worthy jeweller, at first completely taken by surprise, examined\
the necklace, and was horrified to see that Miss Morgan\'92s statements\
were, alas! too true. Mr. Kidd was indeed in a terribly awkward\
position.\
\
\'93The evening before, after business hours, he had taken the necklace\
home with him. Before starting for the theatre, he had examined it to\
see that it was quite in order. He had then, with his own hands, and\
in the presence of his wife, placed it in its case, and driven\
straight to the Novelty, where he finally gave it over to Miss Morgan\
herself.\
\
\'93To all this he swore most positively; moreover, all his _employ\'e9s_\
and workmen could swear that they had last seen the necklace just\
after closing time at the shop, when Mr. Kidd walked off towards\
Piccadilly, with the precious article in the inner pocket of his coat.\
\
\'93One point certainly was curious, and undoubtedly helped to deepen the\
mystery which to this day clings to the affair at the Novelty Theatre.\
\
\'93When Mr. Kidd handed the packet containing the necklace to Miss\
Morgan, she was too busy to open it at once. She only spoke to Mr.\
Kidd through her dressing-room door, and never opened the packet till\
nearly an hour later, after she had dressed ready for the second act;\
the packet at that time had been untouched, and was wrapped up just as\
she had had it from Mr. Kidd\'92s own hands. She undid the packet, and\
handled the pearls; certainly, by the artificial light she could see\
nothing wrong with the necklace.\
\
\'93Poor Mr. Kidd was nearly distracted with the horror of his position.\
Thirty years of an honest reputation suddenly tarnished with this\
awful suspicion\'97for he realised at once that Miss Morgan refused to\
believe his statements; in fact, she openly said that she would\'97unless\
immediate compensation was made to her\'97place the matter at once in the\
hands of the police.\
\
\'93From the stormy interview in Bond Street, the irate actress drove at\
once to Scotland Yard; but the old-established firm of Kidd and Co.\
was not destined to remain under any cloud that threatened its\
integrity.\
\
\'93Mr. Kidd at once called upon his solicitor, with the result that an\
offer was made to Miss Morgan, whereby the jeweller would deposit the\
full value of the original necklace, _i.e._, \'a310,000, in the hands of\
Messrs. Bentley and Co., bankers, that sum to be held by them for a\
whole year, at the end of which time, if the perpetrator of the fraud\
had not been discovered, the money was to be handed over to Miss\
Morgan in its entirety.\
\
\'93Nothing could have been more fair, more equitable, or more just, but\
at the same time nothing could have been more mysterious.\
\
\'93As Mr. Kidd swore that he had placed the real pearls in Miss Morgan\'92s\
hands, and was ready to back his oath by the sum of \'a310,000, no more\
suspicion could possibly attach to him. When the announcement of his\
generous offer appeared in the papers, the entire public approved and\
exonerated him, and then turned to wonder who the perpetrator of the\
daring fraud had been.\
\
\'93How came a valueless necklace in exact imitation of the original one\
to be in Miss Morgan\'92s dressing-room? Where were the real pearls?\
Clearly the loafer who had drugged the stage door-keeper, and sneaked\
into the theatre to steal a necklace, was not aware that he was\
risking several years\'92 hard labour for the sake of a worthless trifle.\
He had been one of the many dupes of this extraordinary adventure.\
\
\'93Macpherson, one of the most able men on the detective staff, had,\
indeed, his work cut out. The police were extremely reticent, but, in\
spite of this, one or two facts gradually found their way into the\
papers, and aroused public interest and curiosity to its highest\
pitch.\
\
\'93What had transpired was this:\
\
\'93Clara Knight, the dresser, had been very rigorously cross-questioned,\
and, from her many statements, the following seemed quite positive.\
\
\'93After the curtain had rung up for the second act, and Miss Morgan had\
left her dressing-room, Knight had waited about for some time, and had\
even, it appears, handled and admired the necklace. Then,\
unfortunately, she was seized with the burning desire of seeing the\
famous scene from the wings. She thought that the place was quite\
safe, and that George Finch was as usual at his post.\
\
\'93\'91I was going along the short passage that leads to the wings,\'92 she\
exclaimed to the detectives, \'91when I became aware of some one moving\
some distance behind me. I turned and saw a blue domino about to enter\
Miss Morgan\'92s dressing-room.\
\
\'93\'91I thought nothing of that,\'92 continued the girl, \'91as we all know that\
Mr. Dennis is engaged to Miss Morgan. He is very fond of \'93walking on\'94\
in the ball-room scene, and he always wears a blue domino when he\
does; so I was not at all alarmed. He had his mask on as usual, and he\
was carrying a bunch of roses. When he saw me at the other end of the\
passage, he waved his hand to me and pointed to the flowers. I nodded\
to him, and then he went into the room.\'92\
\
\'93These statements, as you may imagine, created a great deal of\
sensation; so much so, in fact, that Mr. Kidd, with his \'a310,000 and\
his reputation in mind, moved heaven and earth to bring about the\
prosecution of Mr. Dennis for theft and fraud.\
\
\'93The papers were full of it, for Mr. Howard Dennis was well known in\
fashionable London Society. His answer to these curious statements was\
looked forward to eagerly; when it came it satisfied no one and\
puzzled everybody.\
\
\'93\'91Miss Knight was mistaken,\'92 he said most emphatically, \'91I did not\
bring any roses for Miss Morgan that night. It was not I that she saw\
in a blue domino by the door, as I was on the stage before the curtain\
was rung up for the second act, and never left it until the close.\'92\
\
\'93This part of Howard Dennis\'92 statement was a little difficult to\
substantiate. No one on the stage could swear positively whether he\
was \'91on\'92 early in the act or not, although, mind you, Macpherson had\
ascertained that in the whole crowd of supers on the stage, he was the\
only one who wore a blue domino.\
\
\'93Mr. Kidd was very active in the matter, but Miss Morgan flatly\
refused to believe in her _fianc\'e9\'92s_ guilt. The worthy jeweller\
maintained that Mr. Howard Dennis was the only person who knew the\
celebrated pearls and their quaint clasp well enough to have a\
facsimile made of them, and that when Miss Knight saw him enter the\
dressing-room, he actually substituted the false necklace for the real\
one; whilst the loafer who drugged George Finch\'92s beer was\'97as every\
one supposed\'97only a dupe.\
\
\'93Things had reached a very acute and painful stage, when one more\
detail found its way into the papers, which, whilst entirely clearing\
Mr. Howard Dennis\'92 character, has helped to make the whole affair a\
hopeless mystery.\
\
\'93Whilst questioning George Finch, Macpherson had ascertained that the\
stage door-keeper had seen Mr. Dennis enter the theatre some time\
before the beginning of the celebrated second act. He stopped to speak\
to George Finch for a moment or two, and the latter could swear\
positively that Mr. Dennis was not carrying any roses then.\
\
\'93On the other hand a flower-girl, who was selling roses in the\
neighbourhood of the Novelty Theatre late that memorable night,\
remembers selling some roses to a shabbily-dressed man, who looked\
like a labourer out of work. When Mr. Dennis was pointed out to her\
she swore positively that it was not he.\
\
\'93\'91The man looked like a labourer,\'92 she explained. \'91I took particular\
note of him, as I remember thinking that he didn\'92t look much as if he\
could afford to buy roses.\'92\
\
\'93Now you see,\'94 concluded the man in the corner excitedly, \'93where the\
hitch lies. There is absolutely no doubt, judging from the evidence of\
George Finch and of the flower-girl, that the loafer had provided\
himself with the roses, and had somehow or other managed to get hold\
of a blue domino, for the purpose of committing the theft. His giving\
drugged beer to Finch, moreover, proved his guilt beyond a doubt.\
\
\'93But here the mystery becomes hopeless,\'94 he added with a chuckle, \'93for\
the loafer dropped the booty which he had stolen\'97that booty was the\
false necklace, and it has remained an impenetrable mystery to this\
day as to who made the substitution and when.\
\
\'93A whole year has elapsed since then, but the real necklace has never\
been traced or found; so Mr. Kidd has paid, with absolute quixotic\
chivalry, the sum of \'a310,000 to Miss Morgan, and thus he has\
completely cleared the firm of Kidd and Co. of any suspicion as to its\
integrity.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93But then, what in the world is the explanation of it all?\'94 I asked\
bewildered, as the funny creature paused in his narrative and seemed\
absorbed in the contemplation of a beautiful knot he had just\
completed in his bit of string.\
\
\'93The explanation is so simple,\'94 he replied, \'93for it is obvious, is it\
not, that only four people could possibly have committed the fraud?\'94\
\
\'93Who are they?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 he said, whilst his bony fingers began to fidget with that\
eternal piece of string, \'93there is, of course, old Mr. Kidd; but as\
the worthy jeweller has paid \'a310,000 to prove that he did not steal\
the real necklace and substitute a false one in its stead, we must\
assume that he was guiltless. Then, secondly, there is Mr. Howard\
Dennis.\'94\
\
\'93Well, yes,\'94 I said, \'93what about him?\'94\
\
\'93There were several points in his favour,\'94 he rejoined, marking each\
point with a fresh and most complicated knot; \'93it was not he who\
bought the roses, therefore it was not he who, clad in a blue domino,\
entered Miss Morgan\'92s dressing-room directly after Knight left it.\
\
\'93And mark the force of this point,\'94 he added excitedly.\
\
\'93Just before the curtain rang up for the second act, Miss Morgan had\
been in her room, and had then undone the packet, which, in her own\
words, was just as she had received it from Mr. Kidd\'92s hands.\
\
\'93After that Miss Knight remained in charge, and a mere ten seconds\
after she left the room she saw the blue domino carrying the roses at\
the door.\
\
\'93The flower-girl\'92s story and that of George Finch have proved that the\
blue domino could not have been Mr. Dennis, but it was the loafer who\
evidently stole the false necklace.\
\
\'93If you bear all this in mind you will realise that there was no time\
in those ten seconds for Mr. Dennis to have made the substitution\
_before_ the theft was committed. It stands to reason that he could\
not have done it afterwards.\
\
\'93Then, again, many people suspected Miss Knight, the dresser, but this\
supposition we may easily dismiss. An uneducated, stupid girl, not\
three-and-twenty, could not possibly have planned so clever a\
substitution. An imitation necklace of that particular calibre and\
made to order would cost far more money than a poor theatrical dresser\
could ever afford; let alone the risks of ordering such an ornament to\
be made.\
\
\'93No,\'94 said the funny creature, with comic emphasis, \'93there is but one\
theory possible, which is my own.\'94\
\
\'93And that is?\'94 I asked eagerly.\
\
\'93The workman, Rumford, of course,\'94 he responded triumphantly. \'93Why! it\
jumps to the eyes, as our French friends would tell us. Who, other\
than he, could have the opportunity of making an exact copy of the\
necklace which had been entrusted to his firm?\
\
\'93Being in the trade he could easily obtain the false stones without\
exciting any undue suspicion; being a skilled craftsman, he could\
easily make the clasp, and string the pearls in exact imitation of the\
original; he could do this secretly in his own home and without the\
slightest risk.\
\
\'93Then the plan, though extremely simple, was very cleverly thought\
out. Disguised as the loafer\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93The loafer!\'94 I exclaimed.\
\
\'93Why, yes! the loafer,\'94 he replied quietly, \'93disguised as the loafer,\
he hung round the stage door of the Novelty after business hours,\
until he had collected the bits of gossip and information he wanted;\
thus he learnt that Mr. Howard Dennis was Miss Morgan\'92s accredited\
_fianc\'e9_; that he, like everybody else who was available, \'91walked on\'92\
in the second act; and that during that time the back of the stage was\
practically deserted.\
\
\'93No doubt he knew all along that Mr. Kidd meant to take the pearls\
down to the theatre himself that night, and it was quite easy to\
ascertain that Miss Morgan\'97as the hapless heroine\'97wore no jewellery in\
the second act, and that Mr. Howard Dennis invariably wore a blue\
domino.\
\
\'93Some people might incline to the belief that Miss Knight was a paid\
accomplice, that she left the dressing-room unprotected on purpose,\
and that her story of the blue domino and the roses was pre-arranged\
between herself and Rumford, but that is not my opinion.\
\
\'93I think that the scoundrel was far too clever to need any accomplice,\
and too shrewd to put himself thereby at the mercy of a girl like\
Knight.\
\
\'93Rumford, I find, is a married man: this to me explains the blue\
domino, which the police were never able to trace to any business\
place, where it might have been bought or hired. Like the necklace\
itself, it was \'91home-made.\'92\
\
\'93Having got his properties and his plans ready, Rumford then set to\
work. You must remember that a stage door-keeper is never above\
accepting a glass of beer from a friendly acquaintance; and, no doubt,\
if George Finch had not asked the loafer to bring him a glass, the\
latter would have offered him one. To drug the beer was simple enough;\
then Rumford went to buy the roses, and, I should say, met his wife\
somewhere round the corner, who handed him the blue domino and the\
mask; all this was done in order to completely puzzle the police\
subsequently, and also in order to throw suspicion, if possible, upon\
young Dennis.\
\
\'93As soon as the drug took effect upon George Finch, Rumford slipped\
into the theatre. To slip a mask and domino on and off is, as you\
know, a matter of a few seconds. Probably his intention had been\'97if he\
found Knight in the room\'97to knock her down if she attempted to raise\
an alarm; but here fortune favoured him. Knight saw him from a\
distance, and mistook him easily for Mr. Dennis.\
\
\'93After the theft of the real necklace, Rumford sneaked out of the\
theatre. And here you see how clever was the scoundrel\'92s plan: if he\
had merely substituted one necklace for another there would have been\
no doubt whatever that the loafer\'97whoever he was\'97was the culprit\'97the\
drugged beer would have been quite sufficient proof for that. The hue\
and cry would have been after the loafer, and, who knows? there might\
have been some one or something which might have identified that\
loafer with himself.\
\
\'93He must have bought the shabby clothes somewhere, he certainly bought\
the roses from a flower-girl; anyhow, there were a hundred and one\
little risks and contingencies which might have brought the theft home\
to him.\
\
\'93But mark what happens: he steals the real necklace, and keeps the\
false one in his hand, intending to drop it sooner or later, and thus\
sent the police entirely on the wrong scent. As the loafer, he was\
supposed to have stolen the false necklace, then dropped it whilst\
struggling with George Finch. The result is that no one has troubled\
about the loafer; no one thought that he had anything to do with the\
substitution, which was the main point at issue, and no very great\
effort has ever been made to find that mysterious loafer.\
\
\'93It never occurred to any one that the fraud and the theft were\
committed by one and the same person, and that that person could be\
none other than James Rumford.\'94\
\

XII. The Tragedy of Barnsdale Manor\
\
Chapter I\
\
\'93We have heard so much about the evils of Bridge,\'94 said the man in the\
corner that afternoon, \'93but I doubt whether that fashionable game has\
ever been responsible for a more terrible tragedy than the one at\
Barnsdale Manor.\'94\
\
\'93You think, then,\'94 I asked, for I saw he was waiting to be drawn out,\
\'93you think that the high play at Bridge did have something to do with\
that awful murder?\'94\
\
\'93Most people think that much, I fancy,\'94 he replied, \'93although no one\
has arrived any nearer to the solution of the mystery which surrounds\
the tragic death of Mme. Quesnard at Barnsdale Manor on the 23rd\
September last.\
\
\'93On that fateful occasion, you must remember that the house party at\
the Manor included a number of sporting and fashionable friends of\
Lord and Lady Barnsdale, among whom Sir Gilbert Culworth was the only\
one whose name was actually mentioned during the hearing of this\
extraordinary case.\
\
\'93It seems to have been a very gay house party indeed. In the daytime\
Lord Barnsdale took some of his guests to shoot and fish, whilst a few\
devotees remained at home in order to indulge their passion for the\
modern craze of Bridge. It was generally understood that Lord\
Barnsdale did not altogether approve of quite so much gambling. He was\
not by any means well off; and although he was very much in love with\
his beautiful wife, he could ill afford to pay her losses at cards.\
\
\'93This was the reason, no doubt, that Bridge at Barnsdale Manor was\
only indulged in whilst the host himself was out shooting or fishing;\
in the evenings there was music or billiards, but never any cards.\
\
\'93One of the most interesting personalities in the Barnsdale _m\'e9nage_\
was undoubtedly Madame Nathalie Quesnard, a sister of Lord Barnsdale\'92s\
mother, who, if you remember, was a Mademoiselle de la Tr\'e9mouille.\
This Mme. Quesnard was extremely wealthy, the widow of a French West\
Indian planter, who had made millions in Martinique.\
\
\'93She was very fond of her nephew, to whom, as she had no children or\
other relatives of her own, she intended to leave the bulk of her vast\
fortune. Pending her death, which was not likely to occur for some\
time, as she was not more than fifty, she took up her abode at\
Barnsdale Manor, together with her companion and amanuensis, a poor\
girl named Alice Holt.\
\
\'93Mme. Quesnard was seemingly an amiable old lady; the only unpleasant\
trait in her character being her intense dislike of her nephew\'92s\
beautiful and fashionable young wife. The old Frenchwoman, who, with\
all her wealth, had the unbounded and innate thriftiness peculiar to\
her nation, looked with perfect horror on Lady Barnsdale\'92s\
extravagances, and above all on her fondness for gambling; and\
subsequently several of the servants at the Manor testified to the\
amount of mischief the old lady strove to make between her nephew and\
his young wife.\
\
\'93Mme. Quesnard\'92s dislike for Lady Barnsdale seems, moreover, to have\
been shared by her dependent and companion, the girl Alice Holt.\
Between them, these two ladies seem to have cordially hated the\
brilliant and much-admired mistress of Barnsdale Manor.\
\
\'93Such were the chief inmates of the Manor last September, at the time\
the tragedy occurred. On that memorable night Alice Holt, who occupied\
a bedroom immediately above that of Mme. Quesnard, was awakened in the\
middle of the night by a persistent noise, which undoubtedly came from\
her mistress\'92s room. The walls and floorings at the old Manor are very\
thick, and the sound was a very confused one, although the girl was\
quite sure that she could hear Mme. Quesnard\'92s shrill voice raised as\
if in anger.\
\
\'93She tried to listen for a time, and presently she heard a sound as if\
some piece of furniture had been knocked over, then nothing more.\
Somehow the sudden silence seemed to have frightened the girl more\
than the noise had done. Trembling with nervousness she waited for\
some few minutes, then, unable to bear the suspense any longer, she\
got out of bed, slipped on her shoes and dressing-gown, and determined\
to run downstairs to see if anything were amiss.\
\
\'93To her horror she found on trying her door that it had been locked on\
the outside. Quite convinced now that something must indeed be very\
wrong, she started screaming and banging against the door, determined\
to arouse the household, which she, of course, quickly succeeded in\
doing.\
\
\'93The first to emerge from his room was Lord Barnsdale. He at once\
realised that the shrieks proceeded from Alice Holt\'92s room. He ran\
upstairs helter-skelter, and as the key had been left in the door, he\
soon released the unfortunate girl, who by now was quite hysterical\
with anxiety for her mistress.\
\
\'93Altogether, I take it, some six or seven minutes must have elapsed\
from the time when Alice Holt was first alarmed by the sudden silence\
following the noise in Mme. Quesnard\'92s room until she was released by\
Lord Barnsdale.\
\
\'93As quickly and as coherently as she could, she blurted forth all her\
fears about her mistress. I can imagine how picturesque the old Manor\
House must have looked then, with everybody, ladies and gentlemen, and\
servants, crowding into the hall, arrayed in various _n\'e9glig\'e9_ attire,\
asking hurried questions, getting in each other\'92s way, and all only\
dimly to be seen by the light of candles, carried by some of the more\
sensible ones in this motley crowd.\
\
\'93However, in the meanwhile, Lord Barnsdale had managed to understand\
Alice Holt. He ran downstairs again and knocked at his aunt\'92s door; he\
received no reply\'97he tried the handle, but the door was locked from\
the inside.\
\
\'93Genuinely frightened now, he forced open the door, and then recoiled\
in horror.\
\
\'93The window was wide open, and a brilliant moonlight streamed into the\
room, weirdly illumining Mme. Quesnard\'92s inanimate body, which lay\
full length upon the ground. Hastily begging the ladies not to follow\
him, Lord Barnsdale quickly went forward and bent over his aunt\'92s\
body.\
\
\'93There was no doubt that she was dead. An ugly wound at the back of\
her head, some red marks round her throat, all testified to the fact\
that the poor old lady had been assaulted and murdered. Lord Barnsdale\
at once sent for the nearest doctor, whilst he and Miss Holt lifted\
the unfortunate lady back to bed.\
\
\'93The messenger who had gone for the doctor was at the same time\
instructed to deliver a note, hastily scribbled by Lord Barnsdale, at\
the local police station.\
\
\'93That a hideous crime had been committed, with burglary for its\
object, no one could be in doubt for a moment. Lord Barnsdale and two\
or three of his guests had already thrown a glance into the next room,\
a little boudoir, which Mme. Quesnard used as a sitting-room. There\
the heavy oak bureau bore silent testimony to the motive of this\
dastardly outrage. Mme. Quesnard, with the unfortunate and foolhardy\
habit peculiar to all French people, kept a very large quantity of\
loose and ready money by her. That habit, mind you, is the chief\
reason why burglary is so rife and so profitable all over France.\
\
\'93In this case the old lady\'92s national characteristic was evidently the\
chief cause of her tragic fate; the drawer of the bureau had been\
forced open, and no one could doubt for a moment that a large sum of\
money had been abstracted from it.\
\
\'93The burglar had then obviously made good his escape through the\
window, which he could do quite easily, as Mme. Quesnard\'92s apartments\
were on the ground floor. She suffered from shortness of breath, it\
appears, and had a horror of stairs; she was, moreover, not the least\
bit nervous, and her windows were usually barred and shuttered.\
\
\'93One very curious fact, however, at once struck all those present,\
even before the arrival of the detectives, and that was, that the old\
lady was partially dressed when she was found lying on the ground. She\
had slipped on an elaborate dressing-gown, had smoothed her hair, and\
put on her slippers. In fact, it was evident that she had in some\
measure prepared herself for the reception of the burglar.\
\
\'93Throughout these hasty and amateurish observations conducted by Lord\
Barnsdale and two of his male guests, Alice Holt had remained seated\
beside her late employer\'92s bedside sobbing bitterly. In spite of Lord\
Barnsdale\'92s entreaties she refused to move; and wildly waved aside any\
attempt at consolation offered to her by one or two of the older\
female servants who were present.\
\
\'93It was only when everybody at last made up their minds to return to\
their rooms, that some one mentioned Lady Barnsdale\'92s name. She had\
been taken ill and faint the evening before, and had not been well all\
night. Jane Barlow, her maid, expressed the hope that her ladyship was\
none the worse for this awful commotion, and must be wondering what it\
all meant.\
\
\'93At this, suddenly, Alice Holt jumped up, like a madwoman.\
\
\'93\'91What it all means?\'92 she shrieked, whilst every one looked at her in\
speechless horror, \'91it means that that woman has murdered my mistress,\
and robbed her. I know it\'97I know it\'97I know it!\'92\
\
\'93And once more sinking beside the bed, she covered her dead mistress\'92s\
hand with kisses, and sobbed and wailed as if her heart would break.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter II\
\
\'93You may well imagine the awful commotion the girl\'92s wild outburst had\
created in the old Manor House. Lady Barnsdale had been taken ill the\
previous evening, and, of course, no one had breathed a word of it to\
her, but equally, of course, it was freely talked about at Barnsdale\
Manor, in the neighbourhood, and even so far as in the London clubs.\
\
\'93Lord and Lady Barnsdale were very well known in London society, and\
Lord Barnsdale\'92s adoration for his beautiful wife was quite notorious.\
\
\'93Alice Holt, after her frantic outburst, had not breathed another\
word. Silent and sullen she went up to her room, packed her things,\
and left the house, where, of course, it became impossible that she\
should stay another day. She refused Lord Barnsdale\'92s generous offer\
of money and help, and only stayed long enough to see the detectives\
and reply to the questions they thought fit to put to her.\
\
\'93The whole neighbourhood was in a fever of excitement; many gossips\
would have it that the evidence against Lady Barnsdale was conclusive,\
and that a warrant for her arrest had already been applied for.\
\
\'93What had transpired was this:\
\
\'93It appears that the day preceding the tragedy, Bridge was, as usual,\
being played for, I believe, guinea points. Lord Barnsdale was out\
shooting all day, and though the guests at the Manor were very loyal\
to their hostess, and refused to make any positive statements, there\
seems to be no doubt that Lady Barnsdale lost a very large sum of\
money to Sir Gilbert Culworth.\
\
\'93Be that as it may, nothing further could be gleaned by enterprising\
reporters fresh from town; the police were more than usually reticent,\
and every one eagerly awaited the opening of the inquest, when\
sensational developments were expected in this mysterious case.\
\
\'93It was held on September the 25th, in the servants\'92 hall of Barnsdale\
Manor, and you may be sure that the large room was crowded to its\
utmost capacity. Lord Barnsdale was, of course, present, so was Sir\
Gilbert Culworth, but it was understood that Lady Barnsdale was still\
suffering from nervous prostration, and was unable to be present.\
\
\'93When I arrived there, and gradually made my way to the front rank,\
the doctor who had been originally summoned to the murdered lady\'92s\
bedside was giving his evidence.\
\
\'93He gave it as his opinion that the fractured skull from which Mme.\
Quesnard died was caused through her hitting the back of her head\
against the corner of the marble-topped washstand, in the immediate\
proximity of which she lay outstretched, when Lord Barnsdale first\
forced open the door. The stains on the marble had confirmed him in\
that opinion. Mme. Quesnard, he thought, must have fallen, owing to an\
onslaught made upon her by the burglar; the marks round the old lady\'92s\
throat testified to this, although these were not the cause of death.\
\
\'93After this there was a good deal of police evidence, with regard to\
the subsequent movements of the unknown miscreant. He had undoubtedly\
broken open the drawer of the bureau in the adjoining boudoir, the\
door of communication between this and Mme. Quesnard\'92s bedroom being\
always kept open, and it was presumed that he had made a considerable\
haul both in gold and notes. He had then locked the bedroom door on\
the inside and made good his escape through the window.\
\
\'93Immediately beneath this window, the flower-bed, muddy with the\
recent rain, bore the imprint of having been hastily trampled upon;\
but all actual footmarks had been carefully obliterated. Beyond this,\
all round the house, the garden paths are asphalted, and the burglar\
had evidently taken the precaution to keep to these asphalted paths,\
or else to cross the garden by the lawns.\
\
\'93You must understand,\'94 continued the man in the corner, after a slight\
pause, \'93that throughout all this preliminary evidence, everything went\
to prove that the crime had been committed by an inmate of the house,\
or at any rate by some one well acquainted with its usages and its\
_m\'e9nages_. Alice Holt, whose room was immediately above that of Mme.\
Quesnard, and who was, therefore, most likely to hear the noise of the\
conflict and to run to her mistress\'92s assistance, had been first of\
all locked up in her room. It had, therefore, become quite evident\
that the miscreant had commenced operations from inside the house, and\
had entered Mme. Quesnard\'92s room by the door, and not by the window,\
as had been at first supposed.\
\
\'93But,\'94 added the funny creature excitedly, \'93as the old lady had,\
according to evidence, locked her door that night, it became more and\
more clear, as the case progressed, that she must of her own accord\
have admitted the person who subsequently caused her tragic death.\
This was, of course, confirmed by the fact that she was partially\
dressed when she was subsequently found dead.\
\
\'93Strangely enough, with the exception of Alice Holt, no one else had\
heard any noise during the night. But, as I remarked before, the walls\
of these old houses are very thick, and no one else slept on the\
ground floor.\
\
\'93Another fact which in the early part of the inquest went to prove\
that the outrage was committed by some one familiar with the house,\
was that Ben, the watch-dog, had not raised any alarm. His kennel was\
quite close to Mme. Quesnard\'92s windows, and he had not even barked.\
\
\'93I doubt if the law would take official cognisance of the dumb\
testimony of a dog; nevertheless, Ben\'92s evidence was in this case\
quite worthy of consideration.\
\
\'93You may imagine how gradually, as these facts were unfolded,\
excitement grew to fever pitch, and when at last Alice Holt was\
called, every one literally held their breath, eagerly waiting to hear\
what was coming.\
\
\'93She is a tall, handsome-looking girl, with fine eyes and a rich\
voice. Dressed in deep black she certainly looked an imposing figure\
as she stood there, repeating the story of how she was awakened in the\
night, by the sound of her mistress\'92s angry voice, of the noise and\
sudden silence, and also of her terror, when she found that she had\
been locked up in her room.\
\
\'93But obviously the girl had more to tell, and was only waiting for the\
coroner\'92s direct question.\
\
\'93\'91Will you tell the jury the reason why you made such an extraordinary\
and unwarrantable accusation against Lady Barnsdale?\'92 he asked her at\
last, amid breathless silence in the crowded room.\
\
\'93Every one instinctively looked across the room to where Lord\
Barnsdale sat between his friend Sir Gilbert Culworth and his lawyer,\
Sir Arthur Inglewood, who had evidently come down from London in order\
to watch the case on his client\'92s behalf. Alice Holt, too, looked\
across at Lord Barnsdale for a moment. He seemed attentive and\
interested, but otherwise quite calm and impassive.\
\
\'93I, who watched the girl, saw a look of pity cross her face as she\
gazed at him, and I think, when we bear in mind that the distinguished\
English gentleman and the poor paid companion had known each other\
years ago, when they were girl and boy together in old Mme. Quesnard\'92s\
French home, we may make a pretty shrewd guess why Alice Holt hated\
the beautiful Lady Barnsdale.\
\
\'93\'91It was about six o\'92clock in the afternoon,\'92 she began at last, in\
the same quiet tone of voice, \'91I was sitting sewing in Madame\'92s\
boudoir, when Lady Barnsdale came into the bedroom. She did not see\
me, I know, for she began at once talking volubly to Madame about a\
serious loss she had just sustained at Bridge; several hundred pounds,\
she said.\'92\
\
\'93\'91Well?\'92 queried the coroner, for the girl had paused, almost as if\
she regretted what she had already said. She certainly threw an\
appealing look at Lord Barnsdale, who, however, seemed to take no\
notice of her.\
\
\'93\'91Well,\'92 she continued with sudden resolution, \'91Madame was very angry\
at this; she declared that Lady Barnsdale deserved a severe lesson;\
her extravagances were a positive scandal. \'93Not a penny will I give\
you to pay your gambling debts,\'94 said Madame; \'93and, moreover, I shall\
make it my business to inform my nephew of your goings-on whilst he is\
absent.\'94\
\
\'93\'91Lady Barnsdale was in a wild state of excitement. She begged and\
implored Madame to say nothing to Lord Barnsdale about it, and did her\
very best to try to induce her to help her out of her difficulties,\
just this once more. But Madame was obdurate. Thereupon Lady Barnsdale\
turned on her like a fury, called her every opprobrious name under the\
sun, and finally flounced out of the room, banging the door behind\
her.\
\
\'93\'91Madame was very much upset after this,\'92 continued Alice Holt, \'91and I\
was not a bit astonished when directly after dinner she rang for me,\
and asked to be put to bed. It was then nine o\'92clock.\
\
\'93\'91That is the last I saw of poor Madame alive.\
\
\'93\'91She was very excited then, and told me that she was quite frightened\
of Lady Barnsdale\'97a gambler, she said, was as likely as not to become\
a thief, if opportunity arose. I offered to sleep on the sofa in the\
next room, for the old lady seemed quite nervous, a thing I have never\
known her to be. But she was too proud to own to nervousness, and she\
dismissed me finally, saying that she would lock her door, for once: a\
thing she scarcely ever did.\'92\
\
\'93It was a curious story, to say the least of it, which Alice Holt thus\
told to an excited public. Cross-examined by the coroner, she never\
departed from a single point of it, her calm and presence of mind\
being only equalled throughout this trying ordeal by that of Lord\
Barnsdale, who sat seemingly unmoved whilst these terrible\
insinuations were made against his wife.\
\
\'93But there was more to come. Sir Gilbert Culworth had been called; in\
the interest of justice, and in accordance with his duty as a citizen,\
he was forced to stand up and, all unwillingly, to add another tiny\
link to the chain of evidence that implicated his friend\'92s wife in\
this most terrible crime.\
\
\'93Right loyally he tried to shield her in every possible way, but\
cross-questioned by the coroner, harassed nearly out of his senses, he\
was forced to admit two facts\'97namely, that Lady Barnsdale had lost\
nearly \'a3800 at Bridge the day before the murder, and that she had paid\
her debt to himself in full, on the following morning, in gold and\
notes.\
\
\'93He had been forced, much against his will, to show the notes to the\
police; unfortunately for the justice of the case, however, the\
numbers of these could not be directly traceable as having been in\
Mme. Quesnard\'92s possession at the time of her death. No diaries or\
books of accounts of any kind were found. Like most French people, she\
arranged all her money affairs herself, receiving her vast dividends\
in foreign money, and converting this into English notes and gold, as\
occasion demanded, at the nearest money-changer\'92s that happened to be\
handy.\
\
\'93She had, like a great many foreigners, a holy horror of banks. She\
would have mistrusted the Bank of England itself; as for solicitors,\
she held them in perfect abhorrence. She only went once to one in her\
life, and that was in order to make a will leaving everything she\
possessed unconditionally to her beloved nephew, Lord Barnsdale.\
\
\'93But in spite of this difficulty about the notes, you see for\
yourself, do you not, how terribly strong was the circumstantial\
evidence against Lady Barnsdale? Her losses at cards, her appeal to\
Mme. Quesnard, the latter\'92s refusal to help her, and finally the\
payment in full of the debt to Sir Gilbert Culworth on the following\
morning.\
\
\'93There was only one thing that spoke for her, and that was the very\
horror of the crime itself. It was practically impossible to conceive\
that a woman of Lady Barnsdale\'92s refinement and education should have\
sprung upon an elderly woman, like some navvy\'92s wife by the docks, and\
then that she should have had the presence of mind to jump out of the\
window, to obliterate her footmarks in the flower-bed, and, in fact,\
to have given the crime the look of a clever burglary.\
\
\'93Still, we all know that money difficulties will debase the noblest of\
us, that greed will madden the sanest and most refined. When the\
inquest was adjourned, I can assure you that no one had any doubt\
whatever that within twenty-four hours Lady Barnsdale would be\
arrested on the capital charge.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter III\
\
\'93But the detectives in charge of the case had reckoned without Sir\
Arthur Inglewood, the great lawyer, who was watching the proceedings\
on behalf of his aristocratic clients,\'94 said the man in the corner,\
when he had assured himself of my undivided attention.\
\
\'93The adjourned inquest brought with it, I assure you, its full quota\
of sensation. Again Lord Barnsdale was present, calm, haughty, and\
impassive, whilst Lady Barnsdale was still too ill to attend. But she\
had made a statement upon oath, in which, whilst flatly denying that\
her interview with the deceased at 6 p.m. had been of an acrimonious\
character as alleged by Alice Holt, she swore most positively that all\
through the night she had been ill, and had not left her room after\
11.30 p.m.\
\
\'93The first witness called after this affidavit had been read was Jane\
Barlow, Lady Barnsdale\'92s maid.\
\
\'93The girl deposed that on that memorable evening preceding the murder,\
she went up to her mistress\'92s room at about 11.30 in order to get\
everything ready for the night. As a rule, of course, there was nobody\
about in the bedroom at that hour, but on this occasion when Jane\
Barlow entered the room, which she did without knocking, she saw her\
mistress sitting by her desk.\
\
\'93\'91Her ladyship looked up when I came in,\'92 continued Jane Barlow, \'91and\
seemed very cross with me for not knocking at the door. I apologised,\
then began to get the room tidy; as I did so I could see that my lady\
was busy counting a lot of money. There were lots of sovereigns and\
banknotes. My lady put some together in an envelope and addressed it,\
then she got up from her desk and went to lock up the remainder of the\
money in her jewel safe.\'92\
\
\'93\'91And this was at what time?\'92 asked the coroner.\
\
\'93\'91At about half-past eleven, I think, sir,\'92 repeated the girl.\
\
\'93\'91Well,\'92 said the coroner, \'91did you notice anything else?\'92\
\
\'93\'91Yes,\'92 replied Jane, \'91whilst my lady was at her safe, I saw the\
envelope in which she had put the money lying on the desk. I couldn\'92t\
help looking at it, for I knew it was ever so full of banknotes, and I\
saw that my lady had addressed it to Sir Gilbert Culworth.\'92\
\
\'93At this point Sir Arthur Inglewood jumped to his feet and handed\
something over to the coroner; it was evidently an envelope which had\
been torn open. The coroner looked at it very intently, then suddenly\
asked Jane Barlow if she had happened to notice anything about the\
envelope which was lying on her ladyship\'92s desk that evening.\
\
\'93\'91Oh, yes, sir!\'92 she replied unhesitatingly, \'91I noticed my lady had\
made a splotch, right on top of the C in Sir Gilbert Culworth\'92s name.\'92\
\
\'93\'91This, then, is the envelope,\'92 was the coroner\'92s quiet comment, as he\
handed the paper across to the girl.\
\
\'93\'91Yes, there\'92s the splotch,\'92 she replied, \'91I\'92d know it anywhere.\'92\
\
\'93So you see,\'94 continued the man in the corner, with a chuckle, \'93that\
the chain of circumstantial evidence against Lady Barnsdale was\
getting somewhat entangled. It was indeed fortunate for her that Sir\
Gilbert Culworth had not destroyed the envelope in which she had\
handed him over the money on the following day.\
\
\'93Alice Holt, as you know, heard the conflict and raised the alarm much\
later in the night, when everybody was already in bed, whilst long\
before that Lady Barnsdale was apparently in possession of the money\
with which she could pay back her debt.\
\
\'93Thus the motive for the crime, so far as she was concerned, was\
entirely done away with. Directly after the episode witnessed by Jane\
Barlow, Lady Barnsdale had a sort of nervous collapse, and went to bed\
feeling very ill. Lord Barnsdale was terribly concerned about her; he\
and the maid remained alternately by her bedside for an hour or two;\
finally Lord Barnsdale went to sleep in his dressing-room, whilst Jane\
also finally retired to rest.\
\
\'93Ill as Lady Barnsdale undoubtedly was then, it was absolutely\
preposterous to conceive that she could after that have planned and\
carried out so monstrous a crime, without any motive whatever. To have\
locked Alice Holt\'92s door, then gone downstairs, forced her way into\
the old lady\'92s room, struggled with her, to have jumped out of the\
window, and run back into the house by the garden, might have been the\
work of a determined woman, driven mad by the desire for money, but\
became absolutely out of the question in the case of a woman suffering\
from nervous collapse, and having apparently no motive for the crime.\
\
\'93Of course Sir Arthur Inglewood made the most of the fact that no mud\
was found on any shoes or dress belonging to Lady Barnsdale. The\
flower-bed was very soft with the heavy rain of the day before, and\
Lady Barnsdale could not possibly have jumped even from a ground-floor\
window and trampled on the flower-bed without staining her skirts.\
\
\'93Then there was another point which the clever lawyer brought to the\
coroner\'92s notice. As Alice Holt had stated in her sworn evidence that\
Mme. Quesnard had owned to being frightened of Lady Barnsdale that\
night, was it likely that she would _of her own accord_ have opened\
the door to her in the middle of the night, without at least calling\
for assistance?\
\
\'93Thus the matter has remained a strange and unaccountable puzzle. It\
has always been called the \'91Barnsdale Mystery\'92 for that very reason.\
Every one, somehow, has always felt that Lady Barnsdale did have\
something to do with that terrible tragedy. Her husband has taken her\
abroad, and they have let Barnsdale Manor; it almost seems as if the\
ghost of the old Frenchwoman had driven them forth from their own\
country.\
\
\'93As for Alice Holt, she maintains to this day that Lady Barnsdale was\
the culprit, and I understand that she has not yet given up all hope\
of collecting a sufficiency of evidence to have the beautiful and\
fashionable woman of society arraigned for this hideous murder.\'94\
\
\
\
Chapter IV\
\
\'93Will she succeed, do you think?\'94 I asked at last.\
\
\'93Succeed? Of course she won\'92t,\'94 he retorted excitedly. \'93Lady Barnsdale\
never committed that murder; no woman, except, perhaps, an East-end\
factory hand, could have done it at all.\'94\
\
\'93But then\'97\'97\'94 I urged.\
\
\'93Why, then,\'94 he replied, with a chuckle, \'93the only logical conclusion\
is that the robbery and the murder were not committed by the same\
person, nor at the same hour of the night; moreover, I contend that\
there was no premeditated murder, but that the old lady died from the\
result of a pure accident.\'94\
\
\'93But how?\'94 I gasped.\
\
\'93This is my version of the story,\'94 he said excitedly, as his long bony\
fingers started fidgeting, fidgeting with that eternal bit of string.\
\'93Lady Barnsdale, pressed for money, made an appeal to Mme. Quesnard,\
which the latter refused, as we know. Then there was an acrimonious\
dispute between the two ladies, after which came the dinner hour, then\
Madame, feeling ill and upset, went up to bed at nine o\'92clock.\
\
\'93Now my contention is that undoubtedly the robbery had been committed\
before that, between the dispute and Madame\'92s bedtime.\'94\
\
\'93By whom?\'94\
\
\'93By Lady Barnsdale, of course, who, as the mistress of the house,\
could come and go from room to room without exciting any comment, who,\
moreover, at 6 p.m. was hard pressed for money, and who but a few\
hours later was handling a mass of gold and banknotes.\
\
\'93But the strain of committing even an ordinary theft is very great\
upon a refined woman\'92s organisation. Lady Barnsdale has a nervous\
breakdown. Well! what is the most likely thing to happen? Why! that\
she should confess everything to her husband, who worships her, and no\
doubt express her repentance at what she had done.\
\
\'93Then imagine Lord Barnsdale\'92s horror! The old lady had not discovered\
the theft before going to bed. That was only natural, since she was\
feeling unwell, and was not likely to sit up at night counting her\
money; the lock of the bureau drawer having been tampered with, would\
perhaps not attract her attention at night.\
\
\'93But in the morning, the very first thing, she would discover\
everything, at once suspect the worst, and who knows, make a scandal,\
talk of it before Alice Holt, Lady Barnsdale\'92s arch enemy, and all\
before restitution could be made.\
\
\'93No, no, that restitution must be made at once! not a minute must be\
lost, since any moment might bring forth discovery, and perhaps an\
awful catastrophe.\
\
\'93I take it that Mme. Quesnard and her nephew were on very intimate\
terms. He hoped to arouse no one by going to his aunt\'92s room, but in\
order to make quite sure that Alice Holt, hearing a noise in her\
mistress\'92s room, should not surreptitiously come down, and perhaps\
play eavesdropper at the momentous interview, he turned the key of the\
girl\'92s door as he went past, and locked her in.\
\
\'93Then he knocked at his aunt\'92s door (gently, of course, for old people\
are light sleepers), and called her by name. Mme. Quesnard,\
recognising her nephew\'92s voice, slipped on her dressing-gown, smoothed\
her hair, and let him in.\
\
\'93Exactly what took place at the interview it is, of course, impossible\
for any human being to say. Here even I can but conjecture,\'94 he added,\
with inimitable conceit, \'93but we can only imagine that, having heard\
Lord Barnsdale\'92s confession of his wife\'92s folly, the old lady, who as\
a Frenchwoman was of quick temper and unbridled tongue, would indulge\
in not very elegant rhetoric on the subject of the woman she had\
always disliked.\
\
\'93Lord Barnsdale would, of course, defend his wife, and the old lady,\
with feminine obstinacy, would continue the attack. Then some\
insulting epithet, a word only perhaps, roused the devoted husband\'92s\
towering indignation\'97the meekest man on earth becomes a mad bull when\
he really loves, and the woman he loves is insulted.\
\
\'93I maintain that the old lady\'92s death was really due to a pure\
accident; that Lord Barnsdale gripped her by the throat, in a moment\
of mad anger, at some hideous insult hurled at his wife; of that I am\
as convinced as if I had witnessed the whole scene. Then the old lady\
fell, hit her head against the marble, and Lord Barnsdale realised\
that he was alone at night in his aunt\'92s room, and that he had killed\
her.\
\
\'93What would anyone do under the circumstances?\'94 he added excitedly.\
\'93Why, of course, collect his senses and try to save himself from what\
might prove to be consequences of the most awful kind. This Lord\
Barnsdale thought he could best do by giving the accident, which\
looked so like murder, the appearance of a burglary.\
\
\'93The lock of the desk in the next room had already been forced open;\
he now locked the door on the inside, threw open the shutter and the\
window, jumped out as any burglar would have done; and, being careful\
to obliterate his own footmarks, he crept back into the house and\
thence into his own room, without alarming the watch-dog, who\
naturally knew his own master. He was, of course, just in time before\
Alice Holt succeeded in rousing the household with her screams.\
\
\'93And thus you see,\'94 he added, \'93there are no such things as mysteries.\
The police call them so, so do the public, but every crime has its\
perpetrator, and every puzzle its solution. My experience is that the\
simplest solution is invariably the right one.\'94\

        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project\
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid\

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg\'99\
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all\
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue\

forth in Section 3 below.\
\
1.F.\
\
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg\'99\
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may\
contain \'93Defects,\'94 such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate\
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or\
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or\
cannot be read by your equipment.\
\
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \'93Right\
of Replacement or Refund\'94 described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\
Gutenberg\'99 electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
DAMAGE.\

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you\
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium\
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you\
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in\
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person\
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second\
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If\
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing\
without further opportunities to fix the problem.\
\
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of\
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement\
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the\
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or\
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or\
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the\
remaining provisions.\
\
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\
providing copies of Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works in\
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\'99\
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\
or any Project Gutenberg\'99 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\'99 work, and (c) any\
Defect you cause.\
\
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\'99\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\
from people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\'99\'92s\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\'99 collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\'99 and future\
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\
\
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\
\
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\
Revenue Service. The Foundation\'92s EIN or federal tax identification\
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\
U.S. federal laws and your state\'92s laws.\
\
The Foundation\'92s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'92s website\
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\
\
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\
public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\
\
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\
distributed Project Gutenberg\'99 eBooks with only a loose network of\
volunteer support.\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\
edition.\
\
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\
facility: www.gutenberg.org.\
\
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\'99,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
